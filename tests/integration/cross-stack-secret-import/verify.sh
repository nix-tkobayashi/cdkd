#!/usr/bin/env bash
# verify.sh — cross-stack import of a REDACTED secret-bearing export
# (issues #1934, #2133 and #2146).
#
# THE DEFECT (#1934). Since PR #1899 a secret-bearing output is persisted REDACTED:
# `state.outputs` and the exports index hold the unresolved
# `{{resolve:secretsmanager:...}}` expression rather than the plaintext. A
# cross-stack CONSUMER resolving `Fn::ImportValue` got that stored value back
# VERBATIM and shipped the LITERAL TOKEN to AWS as the property value — a
# predictable credential reference landing in a password field, not merely a
# broken value. The fix re-resolves the imported value, in the PRODUCER's
# region, before returning it.
#
# THE SECOND DEFECT (#2133), which shares this fixture because it needs exactly
# the same two stacks. `cdkd scrub` removes secret plaintext from persisted
# state, and it learns WHICH plaintexts to hunt for by re-resolving the template
# and recording each resolved secret as a NEEDLE. Every resolve context
# `scrubStack` built omitted `stateBackend`, which `resolveImportValue` requires,
# so a secret arriving through `Fn::ImportValue` threw for want of a dependency,
# the throw was swallowed by the per-item best-effort catch, no needle was
# recorded, and scrub exited 0 reporting "no plaintext secrets found" over state
# that may still have held it. The fix wires the backend into one context factory
# AND lifts the cross-stack class out of that catch with a pre-pass that REFUSES
# (`SCRUB_CROSS_STACK_READ_UNRESOLVED`, exit 2) when the read cannot be made.
#
# THE THIRD DEFECT (#2146), which needs one more stack on the same chain. The
# #2133 refusal gates on the DIRECT producer's template carrying a literal
# `{{resolve:`. A stack that merely RE-EXPORTS someone else's export has none, so
# scrubbing the stack at the END of such a chain returned early, found no needle,
# and printed "No plaintext secrets found" while that stack's record still held
# the imported plaintext — the #2133 silent success reached through a re-export.
# The fix follows the chain through the app's templates (visited-set termination,
# so a cycle halts) and refuses naming the head of the chain.
#
# THE FIXTURE. Three stacks:
#   Producer  — a Secrets Manager secret with a KNOWN, non-sensitive JSON value,
#               plus a `CfnOutput` whose value is the {{resolve:...}} token and
#               which carries `Export.Name: CdkdCrossStackSecretPassword`.
#   Consumer  — an SSM `String` parameter whose value is
#               `Fn::ImportValue(CdkdCrossStackSecretPassword)`. SSM is readable
#               back in the clear, which is the only way to prove what cdkd
#               actually SENT to AWS. It ALSO re-exports what it imported, as
#               `Export.Name: CdkdCrossStackSecretReexport` — which makes it the
#               MIDDLE of the chain and gives it a template with no literal
#               `{{resolve:` anywhere in it.
#   ChainConsumer — an SSM `String` parameter whose value is
#               `Fn::ImportValue(CdkdCrossStackSecretReexport)`, two hops from
#               the secret. Scrubbing THIS stack alone is issue #2146.
#
# THE ASSERTIONS, in the order that makes a failure legible:
#   1. PREMISE      — the producer's state.outputs AND the exports index hold
#                     the {{resolve:secretsmanager: EXPRESSION (not plaintext).
#                     If the premise breaks, a passing fix assertion means
#                     nothing. Passes pre-fix too: it is #1899's behaviour.
#   2. THE FIX      — the LIVE SSM parameter equals the secret's plaintext and
#                     carries no `{{resolve:`. This is the ONLY assertion that
#                     discriminates the bug: pre-fix the live value literally IS
#                     the token.
#   3. STATE STAYS  — the consumer's own state holds the EXPRESSION, and the
#      REDACTED       WHOLE state file carries zero occurrences of the
#                     plaintext. Passes pre-fix too (pre-fix nothing was ever
#                     resolved, so nothing could leak); post-fix it is a real
#                     guard, because the fix introduces a resolved plaintext
#                     into the consumer's pass for the first time.
#   4. CONVERGENCE  — a second consumer deploy is a no-op and `cdkd diff`
#                     exits 0. This is the perpetual-UPDATE class (state holds
#                     an expression, the template resolves to plaintext), so
#                     the EXIT CODE is asserted, not only the text: a guard
#                     that greps output but never checks rc has shipped green
#                     over exactly this defect in this repo before.
#   5. SCRUB        — `cdkd scrub` on the PRODUCER, which performs no
#      NEGATIVE       cross-stack read at all: exit 0, nothing scrubbed, no
#      CONTROL        refusal. Without it, a refusal firing on EVERYTHING (or a
#                     "Scrubbed" line the command emits for any stack) would
#                     satisfy assertion 7 for the wrong reason.
#   6. SCRUB        — the consumer's state.json is hand-patched to hold the
#      PREMISE        imported secret's PLAINTEXT, exactly as a pre-GHSA
#                     binary left it, and that is READ BACK from S3 before
#                     anything depends on it. A correct deploy never leaves
#                     such a record (assertion 3 just proved so), so without
#                     the seed both a fixed and a broken binary find nothing
#                     and assertion 7 is vacuous. Its own phase, ahead of the
#                     phase that needs it: this repo has shipped a live arm
#                     that was INERT because the command returned early.
#   7. SCRUB,       — `cdkd scrub` on the CONSUMER must exit 0 (rc CAPTURED,
#      THE FIX        not inferred from text) AND print the POSITIVE marker
#                     `Scrubbed 1 resource record(s) in <consumer>` plus
#                     `Done: scrubbed 1 stack(s).`. Pre-fix it printed
#                     `No plaintext secrets found` and exited 0, so those two
#                     lines are emitted ONLY by the fixed path. "The plaintext
#                     is gone" is a CONFLUENCE POINT — equally satisfied by a
#                     correct scrub and by anything that stopped short — so it
#                     is the stated secondary net, over the current object AND
#                     over every surviving OBJECT VERSION (the bucket is
#                     versioned; a delete marker is not removal).
#   8. SCRUB        — the fix's other half, which assertion 7 cannot see: with
#      REFUSES        the pre-pass deleted the context wiring alone still
#                     resolves the import and 7 still passes. The producer's
#                     state object is delete-markered so the read CANNOT
#                     succeed, and scrub must then exit 2 naming the reference
#                     — where pre-fix the same failure was swallowed and the
#                     stack reported clean. Restored before any assertion runs.
#   9. SCRUB        — the THIRD outcome of the same read, between 7 and 8: the
#      REFUSES AN      read SUCCEEDS but the producer's own state.outputs still
#      UNSCRUBBED      holds the BARE PLAINTEXT, as a pre-#1899 binary left it.
#      PRODUCER        There is then no {{resolve:...}} expression anywhere for
#                      scrub to write into the consumer's leaf, so it must
#                      refuse (SCRUB_CROSS_STACK_PRODUCER_PLAINTEXT, exit 2)
#                      rather than report the stack clean. Assertion 7 cannot
#                      reach it (its producer is scrubbed) and neither can 8
#                      (its producer cannot be read at all); the discriminator
#                      for exactly this branch was implemented WRONG three
#                      times with the unit suite green through two of them, so
#                      it gets a live arm of its own. The consumer is named
#                      ALONE, never --all. Restored before any assertion runs.
#  10. RE-EXPORT    — the #2146 pair, on the stack at the END of the chain,
#      CHAIN           scrubbed ALONE. (a) with every stack healthy, scrub must
#                      RESOLVE through the re-export and rewrite the plaintext
#                      seeded into that stack — a walk that refuses on every
#                      re-export passes (b) and fails here. (b) with the MIDDLE
#                      stack's state.outputs seeded back to the pre-#1899
#                      plaintext, scrub must exit 2, name the middle stack as the
#                      producer, say the evidence came by RE-EXPORT from the
#                      PRODUCER, and prescribe the chain in scrub order. Pre-fix
#                      (b) exited 0 reporting the stack clean, because the middle
#                      template carries no literal {{resolve: to gate on. The
#                      message must NOT be the `declared` verdict — that would
#                      mean the middle template grew an expression and this phase
#                      had silently become a duplicate of assertion 9.
#  11. TEARDOWN     — down the chain (each destroy is refused while the stack
#                     below still names the export in its state.imports[]), 0
#                     errors, state keys gone, both SSM parameters gone, and the
#                     secret FORCE-deleted rather than left in a 7-day
#                     pending-deletion window.

# --- Assertions 5-8: `cdkd scrub` over an Fn::ImportValue-sourced secret ----
#
# ISSUE #2133. Every resolve context `scrubStack` built omitted `stateBackend`,
# which both `resolveImportValue` and `getSameAccountStackState` require. A
# secret arriving through `Fn::ImportValue` therefore threw for want of a
# dependency, the throw landed in the per-item best-effort
# `catch { logger.debug(...) }`, the plaintext never became a NEEDLE, and `cdkd
# scrub` exited 0 reporting "No plaintext secrets found" over a `state.json`
# that may still have held it. The fix wires the backend into one context
# factory and lifts the cross-stack class OUT of that catch with a pre-pass that
# REFUSES (`SCRUB_CROSS_STACK_READ_UNRESOLVED`, exit 2) when the read fails.
#
# WHY THE STATE HAS TO BE SEEDED. Scrub only rewrites a record that actually
# HOLDS plaintext, and a correct deploy never leaves one — assertion 3 above
# just proved this consumer's record holds the EXPRESSION. Against that state a
# fixed and a broken binary both find nothing and the arm is vacuous. The seed
# in step 7 writes the plaintext where a pre-GHSA-p5qg-v9gv-hc7w binary would
# have left it, which is exactly the population `cdkd scrub` exists to repair.
#
# WHAT MAKES EACH STEP DISCRIMINATING, since "the plaintext is gone" on its own
# is a CONFLUENCE POINT — equally satisfied by a correct scrub and by any
# unrelated failure that stopped short of writing anything:
#
#   Step 6      — NEGATIVE CONTROL. `cdkd scrub` on the PRODUCER, which has no
#   (assertion 5)  cross-stack read at all: exit 0, "No plaintext secrets
#                  found", no "Scrubbed" line and no refusal. Without it, a
#                  refusal that fired on EVERYTHING, or a "Scrubbed" line the
#                  command emits for any stack it is pointed at, would satisfy
#                  step 8 for the wrong reason.
#   Step 7      — PREMISE. The seeded plaintext really IS in the consumer's
#   (assertion 6)  state before scrub runs, read back through S3. Its own
#                  phase, ahead of the phase that depends on it: this repo has
#                  shipped a live arm that was INERT because the command
#                  returned early and never reached the new code.
#   Step 8      — THE FIX. The EXIT CODE is captured (`rc`), not merely grepped
#   (assertion 7)  for, and a POSITIVE marker naming the work done is required:
#                  `Scrubbed 1 resource record(s) in <consumer>` plus
#                  `Done: scrubbed 1 stack(s).`. Pre-fix the command prints
#                  `No plaintext secrets found in <consumer>` and exits 0, so
#                  those two lines are emitted ONLY by the fixed path. The
#                  plaintext's absence — from the current object AND from every
#                  surviving OBJECT VERSION, since the state bucket is
#                  versioned and a delete marker is not removal — is the
#                  stated secondary net, never the discriminator.
#   Step 9      — THE REFUSAL. The other half of the fix, and it needs its own
#   (assertion 8)  phase because step 8 passes with the pre-pass deleted (the
#                  context wiring alone resolves the import). The producer's
#                  state object is delete-markered so the read CANNOT succeed,
#                  and scrub must then exit 2 naming the reference — where
#                  pre-fix it exited 0 reporting the stack clean. Restored
#                  immediately, before any assertion runs, so no failure here
#                  can leave the producer unmanageable; and `sweep` deletes the
#                  secret by NAME on every abort path regardless.
#   Step 10     — THE OTHER REFUSAL, and the branch NEITHER step above can
#   (assertion 9)  enter. The read here SUCCEEDS — the producer's state is
#                  readable — but what it hands back is a BARE PLAINTEXT,
#                  because the producer's own `state.outputs` has not been
#                  scrubbed yet. `SCRUB_CROSS_STACK_PRODUCER_PLAINTEXT`, exit
#                  2, and its message names the producer plus the remedy that
#                  actually works (`cdkd scrub <producer>` first). Step 8's
#                  producer holds the EXPRESSION, so its read is healthy; step
#                  9's producer cannot be read at all, so its read THROWS.
#                  Only a producer whose state still stores the plaintext
#                  reaches the discriminator, and that discriminator was
#                  implemented WRONG three times — `carriesDynamicReference`
#                  applied to the RESOLVED value (inverted), the producer's
#                  TEMPLATE (true of both outcomes), and a needle count (wrong
#                  in BOTH directions) — with the unit suite green through two
#                  of them and only a real-AWS run catching the third. What
#                  ships instead READS the producer's stored value and tests
#                  `carriesDynamicReference` on IT, which is a statement about
#                  a real state record and is therefore what this arm exercises.

# Every SURVIVING object version under one stack's key space, grepped for this
# run's plaintext. `head-object` reporting the state file gone proves nothing on
# a VERSIONED bucket: `aws s3 rm` writes a DELETE MARKER, and every byte ever
# written stays readable to anyone with `s3:GetObjectVersion` (issue #2096).
#
# `Versions[]` and not `([Versions, DeleteMarkers][])`: a delete marker carries a
# VersionId too, and `get-object --version-id <marker>` answers 405
# MethodNotAllowed — which would turn every marker into a spurious failure. A
# marker has no body, so it can leak nothing.
#
# ROWS are counted, never `length(...)`: the AWS CLI applies `--query` PER PAGE
# and concatenates, so a >1000-entry listing prints `1000\n189` and a numeric
# test on that is a bash error rather than a count (../s3-versions.sh, trap 3).

# (`SCRUB_CROSS_STACK_PRODUCER_PLAINTEXT`, exit 2) rather than report the stack
# clean, which is the same silent success as #2133 reached one step later.
#
# WHY THIS ONE IS WORTH A REAL-AWS PHASE. The discriminator for exactly this
# decision was implemented WRONG three times: `carriesDynamicReference` applied
# to the RESOLVED value (inverted — `reresolveCrossStackValue` hands back a
# plaintext in BOTH outcomes), the producer's TEMPLATE test (true of both, so it
# refused every consumer of a secret-bearing export), and a needle-count test
# (wrong in both directions). The unit suite was green through two of them,
# because the signals were perfectly correlated across its matrix, and the real-
# AWS arm is what caught the third. What ships now READS the producer's stored
# `state.outputs[<key the read matched>]` and tests `carriesDynamicReference` on
# THAT — a statement about a real state record, which is precisely the thing a
# live producer supplies and a fixture cannot fake into existence.
#
# THE CONSUMER ALONE, NEVER `--all`, and this is a non-obvious way for the arm
# to go vacuous rather than a stylistic choice. `orderScrubTargets` sorts
# producers ahead of their consumers, so a `--all` run would scrub the PRODUCER
# first, turn its stored plaintext back into the expression, and arrive at the
# consumer with the condition already healed — a green phase over a code path it
# never entered.
#
# THE SEED IS ON THE PRODUCER, NOT THE CONSUMER. The refusal is raised by the
# pre-pass walking the consumer's TEMPLATE `Properties`, so it does not depend on
# what the consumer's own state holds; step 8 left that record on its expression
# and this phase leaves it there, which is what makes "the record was not
# rewritten" below a meaningful secondary net.
