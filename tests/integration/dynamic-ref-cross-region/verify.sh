# verify.sh - cdkd dynamic-ref-cross-region integ (issues #1933 + #1957).
#
# Failure-seeking test for the REGION dimension of cdkd's resolved
# dynamic-reference cache. `{{resolve:ssm:...}}` / `{{resolve:secretsmanager:...}}`
# values are REGIONAL: the same NAME in us-east-1 and us-west-2 is two
# different values. cdkd's cache used to be a process-global map keyed by the
# expression STRING alone, so in a run spanning regions the first region to
# resolve an expression won it for every later stack in every other region.
#
# The fixture:
#   1. creates the SAME SSM parameter name in TWO regions, with DIFFERENT
#      values (region A: cdkd-dynref-region-a / region B: cdkd-dynref-region-b);
#   2. deploys TWO stacks — one per region — in ONE cdkd process, each
#      declaring an SSM String parameter whose Value is the identical literal
#      `{{resolve:ssm:<shared name>}}` expression;
#   3. asserts each region's echo parameter carries ITS OWN region's value.
#
# Pre-fix, step 3 fails on the second stack: its resolution hits the cache
# populated by the first stack and writes the first region's value into the
# second region's resource.
#
# DEPLOY IS SERIAL HERE (`--stack-concurrency 1`) AND MUST STAY SERIAL. That is
# a safety requirement, not a leftover from #1933 — read this before "modernising"
# it to the default concurrency, which is the obvious-looking change:
#
#   cdkd installs the per-stack region-pinned AWS clients into a PROCESS-GLOBAL
#   singleton (`setAwsClients`, src/cli/commands/deploy.ts:655) and re-points
#   `process.env.AWS_REGION` with it (`switchRegion`). Serially that is fine —
#   both are re-pinned before each stack. Concurrently (the default is 4) two
#   multi-region stacks race for them, and the race is NOT confined to the
#   dynamic-reference lookups: 42 provider files read `getAwsClients()`, most of
#   them at CALL time, and `switchRegion` mutates `process.env.AWS_REGION` for
#   the whole process. So a lost race CREATES this fixture's echo parameters IN
#   THE WRONG REGION — resources this script's region-keyed cleanup would not
#   delete, i.e. billed orphans, on a run whose purpose is to prove correctness.
#
#   (An earlier version of this note offered `SSMParameterProvider`'s
#   CONSTRUCTOR capture as the proof. That was WRONG and is corrected here:
#   `setAwsClients` and `registerAllProviders` are synchronous neighbours with
#   no `await` between them, and the registry is per stack, so the constructor
#   capture is the one shape that is IMMUNE to the race. The race lives in the
#   call-time readers and in the env mutation. The conclusion is unchanged.)
#
#   Issue #1957 fixed the RESOLVER half of that singleton problem (each lookup
#   is now bound to its resolver's own region — `clientsForRegion` in
#   src/deployment/intrinsic-function-resolver.ts). It deliberately did NOT
#   touch the PROVISIONING half, which lives in deploy.ts and is filed
#   separately as issue #1981. Until that one is fixed, a cross-region deploy at
#   the default concurrency is unsafe to run at all, so this fixture does not
#   run one and #1957's "default concurrency" acceptance criterion cannot be met
#   by a deploy-shaped arm.
#
#   If you come back to build that arm after the provisioning half lands: vary
#   which stack goes first through the DECLARATION order in bin/app.ts, not the
#   argv order — `matchStacks` (src/cli/stack-matcher.ts) walks the cloud
#   assembly's own order and ignores the order the names were typed, so
#   `cdkd deploy B A` deploys in exactly the same order as `cdkd deploy A B`.
#   And run it more than once: a race that interleaves harmlessly once proves
#   nothing.
#
# WHAT PINS #1957 HERE INSTEAD is `cdkd scrub` (phase 3d), which is the issue's
# OTHER site and needs no concurrency to reach the same defect: scrub installs
# its clients ONCE from the CLI region (`scrub.ts:126`) and then resolves stacks
# in SEVERAL regions, so the wrong-region read is structural rather than
# timing-dependent. It also writes no AWS resources, so a failure there cannot
# orphan anything. That makes it both the safer and the STRICTER arm: the
# failure it catches is a DISCLOSURE (plaintext left in state.json), not a wrong
# value.
#
# FOUR arms run per region, and each proves something the others cannot. The
# `String` arm proves the resolved VALUE is region-local. The `SecureString` arm
# (seeded out of band by this script — CloudFormation cannot create one)
# additionally reaches the REDACTION path: cdkd hands the provider the decrypted
# value while persisting the unresolved expression (issue #1901), which is the
# half the cache's per-entry secret verdict decides. Without it the
# verdict-carrying logic gets no real-AWS coverage at all. A THIRD resource
# repeats the SecureString reference EMBEDDED in a longer string and DependsOn
# the second, so it resolves on a cache HIT whose leaf cannot be repositioned
# from the template — the only arm that fails if the cache entry stops carrying
# its secret verdict. The FOURTH arm is the MIXED-TYPE one: one name that is a
# plain `String` in region A and a `SecureString` in region B. It is the only
# arm whose failure mode is a DISCLOSURE — secret-ness is decided by the
# parameter's TYPE (issue #1901), so a lookup answered by the wrong region
# misclassifies as well as mis-resolves, and region B's value is persisted in
# PLAINTEXT. That is #1957's acceptance criterion 3 and the shape
# `cdkd scrub --all` hits.
#
# SECURITY: three of the seeded values are SecureString plaintexts (the shared
# secure name in both regions, plus the mixed-type name's region-B value). They
# are test data, but they are never printed — assertions compare them and report
# PASS/FAIL only. Anyone extending this file must keep that property: never add
# one to an `echo`, and never let one reach a failure message.
#
# Required env vars:
#   STATE_BUCKET - cdkd state bucket (e.g. cdkd-state-{accountId})
#   AWS_REGION   - region A, defaults to us-east-1
#   SECOND_REGION - region B, defaults to us-west-2 (auto-flips if it equals A)

# --- issue #1097 pattern 2: strict gone-probe helpers -----------------------
# A destroy/leak assertion must distinguish "not found" from any other probe
# failure (throttle, auth, network); a blind `if aws ...; then` reads ANY
# failure as "gone" and silently passes the leak check.
# gone_probe returns 0 when the probe fails with a not-found error (resource
# confirmed gone), 1 when the probe succeeds (resource still exists), and
# hard-FAILs the run on any other probe failure (undetermined result).
# The first-arg guard catches a forgotten assert_gone description: without it,
# `assert_gone aws ...` would exec `lambda get-function ...` and the shell's
# "command not found" error would match the signature -- a silent pass.

# resolver. So this echoes ${EXPECTED_A} pre-fix and ${EXPECTED_B} post-fix.
#
# WHAT THE LIVE MUTATION PROBE ACTUALLY SHOWED, recorded because it corrects the
# sentence above and the issue's own framing. With the routing reverted and dist
# rebuilt, this arm went RED -- but at DEPLOY time, not here: SSM validates the
# ARN's region against the endpoint and answered
# `Incorrect region in: arn:aws:ssm:us-west-2:...`, so the resource failed to
# create and this assertion was never reached. For an ARN-form reference the
# pre-fix behaviour is therefore a hard FAILURE, not a silent wrong-region read.
#
# The assertion below is still the right one and is NOT vacuous -- under the fix
# it passes with a value that can only have come from region B -- but its red is
# delivered by AWS rejecting the call rather than by a wrong value arriving. The
# wrong-VALUE path is fenced by the unit matrix in
# `tests/unit/deployment/intrinsic-resolver-assembled-secret-region.test.ts`,
# whose fakes answer both regions successfully and so can tell the two apart.
# The SILENT-miss shape the issue describes belongs to the region-LESS spelling,
# which the `ambiguous` refusal covers.

# (src/cli/commands/scrub.ts:126), and then walks stacks in SEVERAL regions
# building one resolver per stack. So the wrong-region read is STRUCTURAL here —
# no concurrency, no race, nothing timing-dependent — which is what makes this
# arm a deterministic discriminator where a concurrent deploy would only be a
# probabilistic one (and, per the header, an unsafe one).
#
# The command is run with the ambient region = REGION_A and NO --region flag, so
# region A is what the ambient clients point at and region B is the stack whose
# reference must nonetheless be answered by its own region.
#
# WHY THE STATE HAS TO BE SEEDED FIRST. Scrub only rewrites a record that
# actually holds plaintext, and a correct deploy never leaves one — so against
# freshly-deployed state both a fixed and a broken binary find nothing and the
# arm would be vacuous. The seed below writes region B's CURRENT SecureString
# value into region B's record exactly where a pre-GHSA-p5qg-v9gv-hc7w binary
# would have left it, which is the population `cdkd scrub` exists to clean.
#

# on the RAW leaf and `[^}]+` cannot cross the `}` of an `Fn::Sub` placeholder --
