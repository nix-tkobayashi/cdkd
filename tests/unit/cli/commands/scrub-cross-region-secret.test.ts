/**
 * `cdkd scrub` must not re-resolve a secret reference that belongs to ANOTHER
 * region against the stack's own region (issue
 * [#2109](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2109), the `scrub.ts` sibling
 * of [#2057](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2057)).
 *
 * scrub learns WHICH plaintexts to look for by re-resolving today's template
 * through one resolver built from the stack's own region. A reference naming
 * another region's ARN was therefore sent to this stack's regional endpoint,
 * and both halves of that go wrong at once: the plaintext scrub exists to
 * remove is never found (the needle is the wrong region's value), so the
 * command reports the stack CLEAN over state that still holds the secret; and
 * the foreign value is a real string, so scanning for it can rewrite an
 * unrelated stored literal.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE FAKES THE SDK CLIENT CLASSES rather than the resolver (the same
 * choice `rollback-executor-cross-region-secret.test.ts` makes, and the reason
 * this suite cannot reuse `scrub.test.ts`'s resolver double): the whole question
 * is WHICH REGION WAS ASKED, and a resolver double has no region to be asked
 * about. The real `IntrinsicFunctionResolver` and the real `AwsClients` are
 * used; only the leaf `SecretsManagerClient` / `SSMClient` are faked, with the
 * CONSTRUCTOR region as the discriminator.
 *
 * The fixture primes the SAME reference with DIFFERENT values in the two
 * regions, which is the ordinary Secrets Manager reality and the only thing
 * that makes "which region answered" observable at all — a fixture where both
 * regions agree cannot tell the fixed path from the broken one.

   * while `scrubStack` wrapped that resolution in
   * `try { ... } catch { logger.debug(...) }` and downgraded the refusal to a

   * the plaintext in `state.json`, and returned normally with `secretsFound: 0`.
   *
   * That is strictly WORSE than not refusing at all: pre-#2134 this shape
   * resolved locally, produced a needle, and the plaintext WAS scrubbed.
   *
   * THE SHAPE HAD TO BE CHOSEN, not guessed, and the first attempt was wrong.
   * A leaf that spells `{{resolve:` literally -- including the template string
   * of an `Fn::Sub` -- used to be caught by the PRE-PASS
   * (`SCRUB_SECRET_REFERENCE_UNCLASSIFIABLE`), which is correctly placed OUTSIDE
   * the catch and so proved nothing about it. The shape that reaches the
   * resolver is the one issue #2134's scope-correction comment names: the
   * OPENING itself is contributed by an intrinsic. Here a template `Parameter`
   * holds the reference as its `Default` and the property is
   * `{"Fn::Sub": "${DbSecretRef}"}`, so the raw leaf is `"${DbSecretRef}"` -- no
   * opening at all, returned by identity, assembled only inside `resolveSub`.
   *
   * Issue [#2157](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2157) has since made
   * the literal-spelling shape reach the resolver too (the pre-pass defers
   * rather than refusing), so this fixture is no longer the ONLY one that gets
   * there. It is kept as-is because it reaches the resolver for a DIFFERENT
   * reason -- the pre-pass never sees an opening at all -- and that route is
   * unaffected by #2157, so it still fences the catch independently.
   *
   * A SECOND case used to sit beside the one below, asserting that the error was
   * NOT the pre-pass's `SCRUB_SECRET_REFERENCE_UNCLASSIFIABLE`. #2157 retired
   * that code, which made the assertion true of every possible outcome, and its
   * replacement (`secretSends` is empty) could not fail independently either --
   * this leaf carries no `{{resolve:` opening, so the pre-pass can never issue a
   * lookup for it whatever the code does. It is DELETED rather than reworded:
   * the case below already discriminates, because the pre-pass's own ambiguity
