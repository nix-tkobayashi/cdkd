   * The `cdkd state orphan` remedy is a TEMPLATE, never a substituted command,

   * `state orphan` DELETES a record. The `region` the destroy refusal is handed
   * is `state.region ?? ctx.baseRegion`, which WAS record-BODY content
   * `getState` did not check against the key it loaded from —
   * measured 2026-09-17: a record planted at `.../us-east-1/state.json`
   * carrying `"region": "eu-west-1"` rendered a pasteable
   * `cdkd state orphan <stack> --stack-region eu-west-1`, aiming a destructive
   * command at a DIFFERENT region's record for the same stack. That is
   * `stackClause`'s misdirection class, one field over.
   *
   * go-to-k/cdkd#3328 fixed the divergence itself — `getState` normalizes a
   * region-scoped record's `region` to its KEY's and warns — so that operand
   * is now the key's region. THIS CASE IS NOT THEREBY OBSOLETE, which is why
   * it keeps its own parameter: the key's region is an S3 key SEGMENT anyone
   * able to write the bucket can choose, and a legacy record still falls
   * through to `ctx.baseRegion`. The builder takes a region it does not own
   * either way, and the bound below is a claim about the BUILDER.
   *
   * The asymmetry with the `cdkd state show` line in the same message is
   * deliberate: that one READS, and substituting into it is `inspectCommand`'s
   * pre-existing behaviour. Measured for go-to-k/cdkd#3516: in every reachable
   * case the substituted region resolves the SAME record the refusal is about —
   * for a v2+ record it is the key's own, and a legacy record is accepted from
   * any region when its body names none and compared when it does — so the read
   * is not a guess even where the destructive operand would be.
   *
   * Since go-to-k/cdkd#3516 the bound is PER LINE rather than over the whole
   * string. One command per line is what lets the pasteable read end a line
   * while the template stays last, and the property this case is really about
   * survives that: the line carrying the destructive template must hold no
   * substituted region for an operator to fill its holes from.

   *
   * So this one keys on the SHAPE a composite key has — two or more

   * in `tests/unit/state/composite-key-collisions.test.ts` and, structurally,
   * `injectiveKeyPrefix` existing at all so a reader has nothing to re-spell.
   * This fence catches the WRITE side; nothing mechanical catches the read
   * side.
