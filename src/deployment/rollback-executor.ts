/**
 * Rollback executor (issue #1183).
 *
 * The reusable engine that reverts a list of {@link CompletedOperation}s —
 * extracted from `DeployEngine` so BOTH callers drive identical semantics:
 *
 * - `DeployEngine` runs it in-process after a failed deploy (automatic
 *   rollback, unchanged behavior except the two fixes below).
 * - The standalone `cdkd rollback` command runs it against a persisted
 *   rollback journal (issue #1183 §journal), so a `--no-rollback` /
 *   interrupted / partially-failed-auto-rollback deploy can be reverted
 *   later.
 *
 * The executor deliberately depends only on `ProviderRegistry`, the stack
 * region, a logger, and an optional event recorder + per-op state-save
 * hook. It does NOT touch `DagBuilder` / `DiffCalculator` / the synthesizer
 * / `ExportIndexStore`, so the command can construct it without any of the
 * engine's synth-side collaborators (rollback never publishes
 * outputs/exports).
 *
 * Two deliberate behavior fixes vs. the pre-extraction in-process path
 * (both are pre-existing gaps; fixing them once benefits both callers):
 *
 * 1. **DeletionPolicy on CREATE rollback** — rolling a CREATE back IS a
 *    delete as far as the policy is concerned (CloudFormation semantics), so
 *    the CURRENT state record's `DeletionPolicy` decides what happens:
 *    - `Retain` → ORPHANED (removed from state, left in AWS). The policy
 *      says KEEP the resource, so cdkd does.
 *    - `Snapshot` → final snapshot, THEN delete (issue #1358), through the
 *      same mechanism matrix as the deploy engine's
 *      `prepareFinalSnapshotForDelete`: atomic delete parameter for the
 *      SDK-routed `ATOMIC_FINAL_SNAPSHOT_TYPES`, an explicit pre-delete
 *      snapshot for `PRE_DELETE_SNAPSHOT_TYPES`, refusal for every other
 *      Snapshot shape (cc-api routing included) unless
 *      `--skip-final-snapshot` opts into the data loss. This arm ORPHANED
 *      alongside `Retain` until #1358: when this file was written cdkd could
 *      not create a final snapshot at all, so leaving the resource behind
 *      was the only non-destructive option — but it silently handed the user
 *      an untracked, billing resource that state no longer knew about.
 *      `src/provisioning/final-snapshot.ts` (#1352 / #1353) removed the
 *      constraint, so the policy is now honored literally.
 *    - `RetainExceptOnCreate` (which exists precisely to allow cleanup of
 *      failed creates) and absent / `Delete` → DELETE.
 * 2. **Idempotent replay skip rules** — so a partially-failed rollback can
 *    be re-run safely (also harmless for the in-process caller, which
 *    replays each op exactly once).

 * re-create inside `update()`. See `CreateContext` in `src/types/resource.ts`.
 *
 * What issue [#3141](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/3141) changed is

 *   {@link refuseMaskedReplayBaseline}, whose case is the same class (a
 *   desired bag that exists and cannot be used): the op counts as a FAILURE,
 *   which keeps the segment from popping so a repaired record can be retried.
 *   "Repairable" is the conservative reading rather than a promise -- the
 *   security review measured that `null` and `[]` carry nothing to repair FROM,
 *   and only a JSON-stringified object really does -- but keeping a
 *   hand-edited artifact costs the user exit 2 and nothing else, while popping
 *   it is irreversible. The RETRY phrase is per-arm: the failed-op arm runs
 *   only under `--revert-failed`, so a plain `cdkd rollback` re-run there
 *   replays the completed ops, pops the whole segment and discards the very
 *   record this refusal preserved (measured by the code review).
 *
 * Reachability, because it decides what the message may promise, and it is NOT
 * uniform across the three arms:
 *
 * - The two {@link replaySingle} arms are reached from the AUTOMATIC rollback
 *   (`deploy-engine.ts` calls `replayRollback` directly), whose ops come from
 *   `state.json` and pass no parser. That is where the throw has a live
 *   producer. On the `cdkd rollback` path go-to-k/cdkd#3149 refuses the same
 *   record at `parseRollbackJournal` first, with its own remedy.
 * - The failed-op arm has NO such producer for its THROW.
 *   `replayFailedOperations` has ONE caller (`src/cli/commands/rollback.ts`),
 *   and that path is fed by `parseRollbackJournal`, whose
 *   `refuseMalformedOperation` runs over `failedOperations[]` as well and
 *   already rejects a non-object `previousState.properties`. So its throw, its
 *   `--revert-failed` retry phrase and the case pinning them are kept for
 *   PARITY -- the three arms answer one question and an arm that answered it
 *   differently would be the defect. Its SKIP half IS reachable: the parser
 *   TOLERATES an absent bag by an explicit decision, so only the present-
 *   but-unusable shapes are filtered upstream.
 *
 * Neither message offers `cdkd rollback --orphan <id>`, but the reason DIFFERS
 * by half and an earlier revision of this comment gave the throw's reason for
 * both under an "Either way" (caught in review):
 *
 * - THROW: the parser refusal precedes that remedy, so it names the JOURNAL
 *   record -- what `parseRollbackJournal` reads.
 * - SKIP: the parser tolerates this record, so nothing precedes anything. The
 *   omission is right for its own reason -- `--orphan` on an UPDATE op only
 *   logs "Leaving X at its new state" and returns, which is the outcome the
 *   skip already produces. Its message says "recorded previous state" rather
 *   than "JOURNAL record", which is the accurate wording for a path whose
 *   record is as often STATE-sourced.
 *
 * The two reviews of this change disagreed about which disposition applied,
 * one reading "state and AWS stay consistent" (true for both) and the other
 * "the skip deletes the only repairable copy" (true only for the present
 * half). The split is the answer to both.
 *
 * Returns `false` when the caller should skip; throws when it must refuse.
 *
 * The three message strings arrive as a NAMED BAG rather than positionally.
 * That is the round-2 BLOCKER's class removed at the type level rather than
 * patched: `remedy` and `retry` are both `string`, a swap between them
 * compiles, and on the `--revert-failed` arm a wrong `retry` tells the
 * operator to run the command that DESTROYS the record this refusal just
 * preserved. Review then measured that two of these positions were 0-red, so
 * assertions alone were not holding the line either.

 *
 *   - neither source names a type (a hand-edited or torn op) — falling back to
 *     `op.resourceType` is exactly the single-type assumption this replaces;
 *   - the two sources disagree — one of them was edited, and nothing says which;
 *   - the types differ with `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack` on either side. The
 *     deploy refuses that pair at plan time (`type-change-guard.ts`), so only a
 *     journal from a binary older than that guard carries one, and what that
 *     deploy left behind is not knowable from the journal: its mis-routed
 *     delete may have destroyed the child it had just created.

    //     resource that is still alive — a duplicate, or an `AlreadyExists`
    //     failure for a user-named type.
    //   - DROPPING `Retain`: the previous deploy persisted `Retain` into
    //     state, the current template omits it, so the engine correctly
    //     DELETES the old resource — and the stale read then classified
    //     `reverse-replacement-readopt` and pointed state at the deleted old
    //     physicalId with NO re-create. State ends up naming a resource that
    //     does not exist, which no later deploy detects as absent. Strictly
    //     worse than the ADD direction, where at least both resources are
    //     real.
    //
    // Both are closed by asking the ENGINE what it did rather than
    // re-deriving it: {@link CompletedOperation.oldResourceRetained} is
    // stamped at the moment the deploy skipped (or ran) the old resource's
    // delete. `??`, not `||` — an explicit `false` is the DROP direction's
    // whole point and must not fall through to the previous-state read.
    //
    // The fallback survives for ONE case: a journal written by a pre-#2603

/**
 * `provider.update()` for a rollback arm, retried unless the provider opts out.
 *
 * Both rollback UPDATE arms need the same three things, and getting any of
 * them wrong is only visible on a recovery path (issue #1461):
 *
 *  - **Retry.** A provider `update()` can issue reads as well as writes (Glue
 *    does a pre-update `GetTable`), and the callers' best-effort catch counts
 *    a transient failure as a real one and moves on, leaving state unreverted.
 *    `deploy-engine.ts` and `drift.ts` have always wrapped their calls; these
 *    arms did not.
 *  - **`disableOuterRetry`.** `CustomResourceProvider` and
 *    `NestedStackProvider` set it AND implement `update()`. Re-invoking a
 *    Custom Resource derives a FRESH RequestId + pre-signed response URL, so
 *    the first attempt's response lands at an S3 key nobody polls — the exact
 *    hang the flag exists to prevent. Those providers retry internally.
 *  - **Interrupt.** `replayRollback` polls interrupts only BETWEEN ops, so an
 *    un-threaded `isInterrupted` leaves Ctrl-C dead for the length of the
 *    backoff schedule per op — ~47s on the generic grid, or ~64s if the op
 *    hits a name cooldown, which rides its own longer grid since issue #2116.
 *
 * A FOURTH thing since issue
 * [#2086](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2086): the call is bound in
 * {@link withCurrentResourceSecrets}, the async-local channel
 * `NestedStackProvider` reads to seed a nested CHILD engine with the pairs the
 * parent already resolved (issue #1903). `resolveReplayProps` has just
 * re-resolved the journal's `{{resolve:...}}` expressions back to PLAINTEXT
 * into `secrets`, so the bag in hand here is exactly the one the deploy engine
 * would have bound — and without the binding a rollback that reverts a
 * nested-stack row calls `NestedStackProvider.update`, the child engine seeds
 * nothing, and the child's `state.json` is rewritten with the DECRYPTED secret.
 * A recovery path that restores the pre-fix behaviour re-opens the very
 * disclosure the fix closes, so "absent reads as undefined, the pre-#1903
 * baseline" is not an acceptable answer HERE, however it reads elsewhere.
 *
 * `NestedStackProvider` is reachable on this path by construction, not in
 * theory: it is one of the two `disableOuterRetry` providers named above that
 * also implement `update()`, and `cdkd deploy`'s in-process auto-rollback runs
 * inside a DEPLOY-mode `withNestedStackContext` (`deploy.ts` passes
 * `nestedTemplates` / `dagBuilder` / `diffCalculator`). Standalone `cdkd
 * rollback` is NOT affected — `rollback.ts` builds a destroy-mode context with
 * none of those three fields, so `requireDeployContext` throws loudly before
 * any child engine is built.
 *
 * Returns the provider's result so the caller can honour
 * `effectiveProperties` (issue #1644) — both revert arms used to write the
 * previous state record back verbatim, dropping a narrowing the provider had
 * just announced and leaving the record describing something AWS does not
 * hold.

/**
 * Re-resolve dynamic-reference SECRET expressions

 *
 * The rollback journal — and the state record the replay writes — store the
 * redacted EXPRESSION, never the plaintext. But a `provider.update()` /

 *
 * BOTH SIDES OF A DIFF ARE CLASSIFIED, not just the bag that is written, and
 * that is deliberate (issue #2057 review). The `revert` / `--revert-failed`
 * arms call this twice — once for the desired bag and once for the CURRENT /

 * things make a wrong-region value there consequential rather than cosmetic:
 * a patch-based provider computes its patch previous-vs-desired, so a wrong
 * previous side can emit a wrong patch or, when both sides carry the same
 * expression and resolve to the same wrong value, silently compute a NO-OP and
 * skip the revert entirely; and every resolved plaintext lands in the SHARED
 * per-op `secrets` map, which is the redaction needle for the state record this
 * op persists, so a foreign-region plaintext mis-redacts that record. In
 * practice both bags carry the SAME expression (state redacts them identically),
 * so scoping the refusal to the written bag would buy a rare case at the cost of

 *
 * The store is keyed by the expression string alone, and that is exactly what
 * makes #1933 possible: two regions sharing one key. An ARN-form key cannot be
 * shared by two regions, so a verdict pinned from a sibling can never contradict
 * another region's for the same key. If a future change ever routes a

 * expressions this replay resolved FROM. Without it two expressions sharing one
 * resolved value collapse onto whichever the replay recorded last, so the state
 * this rollback writes disagrees with the template at one leaf and the next
 * deploy reports a change that never converges — the same defect the four
 * deploy-side writers had, arriving here through the replay instead.
 *
 * It takes `STATE_DERIVED_RULES`, which is every relaxation. The source is a
 * persisted record, so it holds no PUBLIC expressions (a `String` ssm reference
 * is stored resolved) and any `{{resolve:...}}` in it is by construction a
 * secret — that is `trustAnyExpression`. And the bag WAS produced by resolving
 * that source (`resolveReplayProps` -> the provider's `effectiveProperties`),
 * so the two have identical structure and positional array descent is sound —
 * that is `descendArrays`. It is also the SAME generation, resolved one
 * statement earlier in this call — that is `sourceIsSameGeneration`, and this
 * writer is one of only two that can honestly claim it.
 *
 * Using `STATE_SOURCED_READBACK_RULES` here reads plausible and is wrong in the
 * quiet direction: it turns BLIND positional array descent off. BLIND is
 * load-bearing, and an earlier revision of this paragraph omitted it — the
 * concrete loss is narrower than "positional descent is off" makes it sound,
 * by TWO mechanisms rather than one:
 *
 *  - Since issue #1915 a `Tags[]` / ECS `Environment[]` element is reached by
 *    the order-independent KEYED descent either way.
 *  - Since issue #2012 an UNKEYED list is reached too, under corroboration.
 *    That is not a general relaxation: swapping this constant in would satisfy
 *    all three conjuncts of `isReadbackProjectedFromState`
 *    (`trustAnyExpression && !descendArrays && sourceIsSameGeneration`), which
 *    ARMS `refuseUncertifiedReadbackPositions`, and its unkeyed arm walks
 *    element i against element i whenever `unkeyedArrayPairsByAnchors`
 *    corroborates the alignment (index counts match; every position whose
 *    SOURCE subtree carries no dynamic reference is deep-equal on both sides;
 *    every reference-bearing element carries a distinguishing anchor of its own
 *    or, being a bare reference leaf, leans on the array's literal frame; and
 *    no two reference-bearing elements share an order-insensitive anchor
 *    signature).
 *
 * So the residual loss is narrower again: an unkeyed list whose positions ALSO
 * fail to corroborate. The CONCLUSION is unchanged — `STATE_DERIVED_RULES` is
 * still right here, for the reason one paragraph up (the bag was produced by
 * resolving the source, so the two correspond positionally by construction and
 * need no corroboration to say so). What changes is only how much a reader

/**
 * Both retry loops around a reverse-replacement replay-CREATE (issue
 * [#2032](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2032)) — the create-side twin
 * of {@link updateWithRollbackRetry}, and the single place the two replay arms
 * get their `disableOuterRetry` guard.
 *
 * ## The nesting, and why it is required
 *
 * A caller-supplied `isRetryable` REPLACES `isRetryableTransientError`
 * outright, and ANY explicit schedule knob sets `defaultSchedule = false` in
 * `retry.ts`, which is the gate on the dense IAM-propagation path. Both
 * replay-CREATE arms pass BOTH ({@link RECREATE_RETRY_SCHEDULE} plus
 * `isNameCooldownError` / `isRecreateRetryableError`), so a propagation error
 * raised by the re-create — the old execution role was re-created moments
 * earlier in this same rollback, so `CreateFunction` answers `The role defined
 * for the function cannot be assumed by Lambda.` — was non-retryable on
 * attempt 0 and rethrown raw, leaving the resource absent from BOTH AWS and
 * state. The INNER call passes NO knobs and NO classifier, so it gets the
 * dense 26-retry / 47.75s propagation schedule while the OUTER one keeps
 * owning the name-release cadence.
 *
 * ## What the deploy engine's precedents actually are
 *
 * They are two DIFFERENT shapes, and the two rollback arms need one each —
 * this helper is deliberately the sum of both rather than a copy of either:
 *
 *  - Arm 2 (post-delete-new-first) matches the delete-then-re-create sites,
 *    `deploy-engine.ts`'s `--replace` delete-first fallback and its named
 *    replacement, which nest `this.withRetry(...)` INSIDE an outer
 *    `isRecreateRetryableError` retry. Same two loops as here.
 *  - Arm 1 (create-first) has NO such twin. Its deploy-engine analogue is the
 *    property-driven create-first at `deploy-engine.ts:3745`, which calls
 *    `this.withRetry(...)` on its OWN — one default-schedule loop, no outer
 *    custom-classifier loop at all — and whose catch then reads
 *    `isNameCollisionError` to reach the delete-first fallback. Arm 1 is that
 *    shape PLUS the outer SQS-cooldown loop issue #1206 added, so it is the
 *    SUM of both precedents.
 *
 * ## Why the guard lives here and not in `retry.ts`
 *
 * `withRetry` never receives the provider, so it cannot honour
 * `disableOuterRetry` — re-running `CustomResourceProvider.create()` /
 * `NestedStackProvider.create()` mints a fresh pre-signed S3 URL + RequestId
 * and strands the previous attempt at a key nobody polls, and re-running
 * `NestedStackProvider.create()` re-creates child stacks and child state
 * files. That check therefore has to live next to the provider, exactly as
 * `DeployEngine.withRetry` does it.
 *
 * The guard covers BOTH loops, not just the inner one. Guarding only the inner
 * loop left the outer schedule free to re-enter, which measured at 9
 * `create()` calls for a cooldown and 10 for a collision against an opt-out
 * provider — i.e. the exact hazard the flag exists for, arriving through the
 * outer loop instead. A single-shot call still lets a name collision reach the
 * CALLER's catch on attempt 0 (that catch sits outside this helper), so the
 * delete-new-first fallback is unaffected by the opt-out.
 *
 * ## The collision arm is deliberately untouched
 *
 * `isNameCollisionError`'s signature (`already exist(s)` / `AlreadyExists`) is
 * NOT in `RETRYABLE_ERROR_MESSAGE_PATTERNS`, so the inner classifier rejects it
 * on attempt 0 and it reaches the caller's catch on the FIRST outer attempt,
 * exactly as before. The SQS cooldown IS matched by the inner classifier (the
 * generic table carries `wait 60 seconds`), which is the same division of

 * ## The secrets scope, on both call sites (issue #2086)
 *
 * Each caller's `create` thunk binds {@link withCurrentResourceSecrets} around
 * `createProvider.create(...)`, for the same reason
 * {@link updateWithRollbackRetry} does around `update(...)`: a
 * reverse-replacement replay of an `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack` row re-CREATES
 * the child, and an unbound store makes the child engine persist the parent's
 * plaintext. It sits INSIDE the thunk, so it is re-established on every
 * attempt of both loops rather than once around them.
