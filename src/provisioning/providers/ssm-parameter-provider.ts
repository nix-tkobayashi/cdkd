  /**
   * Build the `Arn` attribute for an SSM parameter (issue #1824).
   *
   * WHY THIS EXISTS. An output / cross-resource `Fn::GetAtt` reads the CACHED
   * `resource.attributes[<CFnName>]` in
   * `IntrinsicFunctionResolver.constructAttribute`, which never calls a
   * provider's `getAttribute` — and for an `*Arn` name the resolver's shape
   * guard HARD-FAILS rather than degrading when the cached value is missing and
   * the physicalId is name-shaped (an SSM physicalId IS the parameter name). So
   * `new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'ParamArn', { value: param.attrArn })` failed the
   * deploy until the ARN was cached under its CFn name.
   *
   * SOURCE DECISION — CONSTRUCTED, not read back. `PutParameter` returns only
   * `Version` / `Tier`, so there were exactly two candidate sources, and the
   * rejected one is recorded here so the call stays challengeable:
   *
   *  - `GetParameter`'s `Parameter.ARN` is authoritative, and cdkd already
   *    issues that call in `readCurrentState` / `import`, so it needs no new IAM
   *    permission. It was REJECTED on COST: it would be a brand-new round trip
   *    on EVERY parameter create AND every update, and SSM parameters are among
   *    the most numerous resources in real CDK stacks — a 50-parameter stack
   *    would pay 50 extra reads for a value that is a pure function of data
   *    cdkd already holds, against a project whose whole premise is removing
   *    round trips.
   *  - CONSTRUCTION is deterministic. The parameter ARN is the documented
   *    `arn:{partition}:ssm:{region}:{account}:parameter/{name}`, with the
   *    name's leading `/` folded into the separator — the same formula
   *    `aws-cdk-lib`'s `StringParameter.parameterArn` uses — so nothing has to
   *    be discovered from AWS. It is also the established idiom in this repo for
   *    "the create response carries no ARN": `AppSyncProvider.buildAppSyncArn`
   *    and the four `CloudControlProvider` enrichment sites (KMS key, ECR
   *    repository x2, Kinesis stream) all construct through the same
   *    `getAccountInfo` + `derivePartitionAndUrlSuffix` + `fabricated`-refusal
   *    pair this method reuses.
   *
   * The PARTITION is DERIVED, never hardcoded `arn:aws:` — that hardcoding is an
   * active bug class here (#1794 / #1815), and on a `cn-` / `us-gov-` deploy it
   * would record an ARN naming a partition the parameter is not in.
   *
   * The `fabricated`-account guard (#1730 / #1746) is honored by REFUSING rather
   * than by substituting: `getAccountInfo` catches its own STS failure and
   * answers the placeholder `123456789012`, which carries no wildcard and is
   * therefore invisible to `isPlaceholderArn`, so a fabricated id must yield NO
   * attribute instead of a plausible-looking wrong one. Returning `undefined`
   * degrades to exactly the pre-fix behavior — the resolver's shape guard fails
   * LOUDLY on the name-shaped physicalId — never to a silently wrong value.
   *
   * DEGRADATION ON THE UPDATE PATH is a DELIBERATE trade-off, not one this
   * design avoids. An update result's `attributes` REPLACE the state record's
   * rather than merging into it (`deploy-engine.ts`:
   * `result.attributes ?? (wasReplaced ? undefined : currentResource.attributes)`),
   * so whenever this method degrades during an `update` the returned map carries
   * no `Arn` and the create-time one is DROPPED. Construction does not prevent
   * that — it only swaps WHICH dependency can fail, STS plus the client's region
   * resolver instead of SSM — so read the source decision above as buying one
   * fewer round trip and nothing else.
   *
   * The alternative is to return NO `attributes` at all on the degraded path, so
   * the engine's `??` carries the previous map forward and the `Arn` survives.
   * That is REJECTED: the same map carries `Type` / `Value`, which are the values
   * THIS update just sent. Carrying the previous map forward would answer
   * `Fn::GetAtt [Param, Value]` with the SUPERSEDED value — silently, and to a
   * question cdkd can answer correctly — and would hand `cdkd drift` a baseline
   * AWS does not hold. Dropping the `Arn` instead degrades to the resolver's LOUD
   * `*Arn` shape-guard failure, which is exactly the pre-fix behavior, and the
   * resource's next UPDATE re-records it (as does the deploy engine's re-read
   * on a `Fn::GetAtt` miss, issue #1852). A loud missing value beats a quiet
   * wrong one — the same reasoning the `fabricated`-account arm above applies.
   *
   * Two honest bounds on that "next update re-records it". `getAccountInfo`
   * caches a SUCCESSFUL identity for the process, so within one deploy only a run
   * whose FIRST `GetCallerIdentity` fails degrades at all — but the 10s
   * fabricated-answer TTL then covers every parameter created in that window
   * rather than a random subset. And a plain re-deploy does NOT heal it: a
   * resource whose resolved properties equal its state record is skipped with no
   * provider call, so healing needs a real property change (issue
   * [#1852](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1852), which also covers the
   * resolver message that currently misattributes this to a missing enrichment).
   *
   * NEVER THROWS, and that is enforced here rather than asserted at the call
   * sites. `create` calls this AFTER `PutParameter` has already committed a
   * parameter, so a throw would surface as a failed create over a missing
   * ATTRIBUTE — leaving an orphan that makes the next deploy hit
   * `ParameterAlreadyExists` (the issue #376 class), and the cleanup that exists
   * for that is deliberately out of reach by then. `getAccountInfo` catches its
   * own STS failure, but `config.region()` is a resolver that can reject, so the
   * whole body is wrapped: an unexpected failure degrades to "no Arn recorded"
   * exactly as the fabricated-account arm does.

   * Refuse a physical id SSM's WRITE APIs could never accept (issue #1824
   * review round 3).
   *
   * An SSM parameter's physicalId must always be the parameter NAME, because
   * that is the only thing the write APIs take. `PutParameterRequest.Name`:
   * "You can't enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a parameter, only the
   * parameter name itself", with a name charset of `a-zA-Z0-9_.-` plus `/` as
   * the hierarchy separator; `DeleteParameterRequest.Name` repeats the ARN
   * prohibition verbatim. A COLON therefore cannot appear in any writable name,
   * which is the single predicate used here — it covers both shapes
   * `GetParameter` additionally accepts and this method has to stop:
   *
   *  - an ARN (`arn:aws:ssm:us-east-1:111122223333:parameter/foo`), and
   *  - a version / label SELECTOR (`GetParameterRequest.Name`: "To query by
   *    parameter label, use `"Name": "name:label"`. To query by parameter
   *    version, use `"Name": "name:version"`").
   *
   * Both sail through this provider's existence check, so before this guard the
   * value was RECORDED as the physicalId and the damage landed later and
   * elsewhere: `cdkd deploy` failing at `PutParameter({Name: physicalId})` with
   * a `ValidationException` after a `Value` change, and `cdkd destroy` failing
   * identically at `DeleteParameter`. This is where the bad value ENTERS
   * (`--resource` / `Properties.Name`), so it is where it is stopped.
   *
   * REFUSED, NOT NORMALIZED to the name, and the ARN grammar is the reason. The
   * mapping back is genuinely ambiguous rather than merely awkward:
   *
   *  - The leading `/` is NOT recoverable. `arn:…:parameter/foo` is the ARN of
   *    BOTH the simple name `foo` and the one-level hierarchical name `/foo`,
   *    since the name's leading slash IS the separator — `aws-cdk-lib`'s
   *    `arnForParameterName` renders the two to the identical string, and that
   *    is precisely why CDK needs an explicit `simpleName` flag whenever the
   *    name is a token. Guessing wrong writes a physicalId naming a DIFFERENT
   *    parameter, i.e. converts a loud failure into a silent wrong-resource
   *    write.
   *  - A parameter SHARED from another account has no name form at all
   *    ("For parameters shared with you from another account, you must use the
   *    full ARN"), so for that shape there is nothing to normalize TO.
   *
   * A refusal is a loud, fixable error, and the message names the exact command
   * that prints the name to pass instead.
