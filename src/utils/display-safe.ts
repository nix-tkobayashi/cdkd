/**
 * Make an untrusted value safe to render in a terminal or persist into a log.
 *
 * A LEAF module with no imports, and deliberately in `src/utils/` rather than
 * beside its first caller: issue [#2170](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2170)'s
 * review found the same rule being widened BY HAND one module at a time and
 * missing an instance every round — the change sanitized 1 of 5 readers of
 * `LockInfo.owner`. One shared definition, imported by everything that renders
 * such a value, is what stops the next reader from inheriting nothing.
 *
 * The stripped class is wider than C0 + DEL, which a first cut used and which
 * misses every mechanism that actually forges a line:
 *
 * - `U+0085` (NEL) and the C1 range — xterm reads `U+009B` as CSI in UTF-8;
 * - `U+2028` / `U+2029` — this text is PERSISTED and re-rendered by JSON and
 *   web log viewers, where both are line terminators;
 * - `U+202A`-`U+202E` / `U+2066`-`U+2069` — the Trojan-Source bidi overrides
 *   and isolates, which visually REORDER the command being pasted.
 *
 * Known residual, recorded rather than implied away: the invisible formatters
 * (`U+200B`-`U+200D`, `U+FEFF`) and the bidi MARKS (`U+200E` / `U+200F` /
 * `U+061C`) survive, as do bare RTL letters, which no denylist can reach. All
 * of them can only make a rendered name differ visually from its bytes — the
 * command a user pastes still acts on exactly what is shown, and the blast
 * radius stays the attacker's own stack name.
 *
 * A caller whose value has a KNOWN ASCII charset (a stack name, an AWS region)
 * should pass `asciiOnly`, which is a positive allowlist and therefore has no
 * such residual at all.
 *
 * ONE CALLER DELIBERATELY GOES WIDER, and it is recorded here so an editor of
 * the residual note above knows a second module now disagrees with it.
 * `src/deployment/outputs-export-alias.ts` deletes a class derived from
 * `\p{Cc}` / `\p{Cf}` / `\p{Zl}` / `\p{Zp}` /
 * `\p{Default_Ignorable_Code_Point}`, because on THAT path the subject is a possibly
 * secret-bearing name in an operator's log: a plaintext split by a zero-width
 * character is READ as if it were contiguous, so it is disclosed without any
 * paste, and the command-forgery reasoning above does not transfer (issue
 * [#2874](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2874)). Nothing here changes
 * -- widening this helper would alter every caller that merely wants a
 * terminal-safe string.

 * whole render with it. The fallback is `Object.prototype.toString`, which
 * calls none of the object's own methods — it reads only
 * `Symbol.toStringTag`, a key `JSON.parse` cannot produce — so it cannot
 * throw for any JSON-derived value. Every value `String` already handled
 * renders exactly as before; only the throwing ones change.
 *
 * `safeStringify` in `aws-failure-text.ts` guards the SAME coercion and is not
 * the same helper: it answers a failed conversion with a sentence rather than
 * `[object Object]`, because its output is a persisted failure reason an
 * operator reads rather than terminal output, and it sanitises nothing. This
 * one stays the answer on any path that RENDERS or LOGS the value.

 * `${parentStackName}~${nestedLogicalId}` and applies that RECURSIVELY, one `~`
 * segment per nesting level, so the length grows with nesting depth:
 *
 *     128 + 4 * (1 + 255) = 1152
 *
 * -- a 128-character CloudFormation root name plus four `~` + 255-character
 * logical-id segments, reading CloudFormation's five-level nesting quota as
 * root + 4.
 *
 * Why it needs to be past 255 at all: CDK's generated nested-stack logical ids
 * run ~60 characters (`XNestedStackXNestedStackResource<hash>`), so even a
 * 20-character root passes 255 at the fourth level -- and a name cut there
 * prints `[cut: N more characters withheld]` in the middle of a row that

 * this cap renders byte-identically (a spoofing value still gains quotes --
 * that is rule 3's whole job), and byte-identity on legitimate rows is what
 * makes the boundary rendering safe to adopt at all.
 *
 * TWO THINGS THIS IS NOT, both stated because the first revision of this
 * comment claimed them:
 *
 * 1. It is not an ENFORCED bound. cdkd never calls CloudFormation, and nothing
 *    in `src/` validates stack-name length or nesting depth, so the cap is a
 *    budget rather than a guarantee. It is NOT reachable by nesting deeper: at
 *    CDK's ~60-character generated logical ids even a SIX-level chain is ~494
 *    code points, so depth alone does not approach 1152. What reaches it is
 *    length -- HAND-WRITTEN logical ids near CloudFormation's own 255-character
 *    ceiling, stacked several levels deep. Reading the nesting quota as five
 *    levels BELOW the root would put the figure at 1408. Treat 1152 as CDK
 *    practice with a wide margin, not a proof.
 * 2. It does not keep the genuine trailing annotation on screen. At 255 that
 *    was arguable; at 1152 the `(region)` is many wrapped lines away, and a
 *    terminal WRAPPING a long quoted name can put a visual line that reads
 *    exactly like a genuine row on screen with both quotes scrolled out of
 *    view -- reachable well under either cap, so the raise does not create the
 *    class, but the cap does not close it either. Tracked on
 *    go-to-k/cdkd#3179. What the cap still does is bound the PAYLOAD.
 *
 * Its second GRAMMAR (it already has several call sites) is a failed Stage's
 * path
 * ([#3482](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/3482),
 * `src/synthesis/failed-stages.ts`), a different grammar reusing this cap
 * deliberately: a hierarchical construct path nests without a fixed bound in
 * the same way, and both need "a legitimate value is longer than 255". Named
 * here rather than given its own constant so a retune for one is a decision
 * about the other — which is the whole point of the rule above.

 *    terminal then WRAPS: a long quoted value can still wrap so that a visual
 *    line reads like a genuine row with the quotes off-screen, at either cap.
 *    A caller whose identifier has a LONGER legitimate grammar passes its own
 *    cap -- `STACK_REF_MAX_CODE_POINTS` is the one such caller today -- because
 *    a cut that fires on a LEGITIMATE value breaks the byte-identity that makes
 *    rule 3 safe to adopt at all.
 * 3. A value is rendered as a JSON string literal -- so its BOUNDARY is
 *    visible -- unless BOTH of these hold: sanitization was the IDENTITY on it,
 *    and what is left is a `PLAIN_IDENT`. The allowlist alone cannot stop an
 *    all-ASCII `X (AWS::RDS::DBInstance) -- already reverted` from reading as
 *    cdkd's own annotation inside a real row; quoting it makes the row read
 *    `"X (AWS::RDS::DBInstance) -- already reverted" (AWS::S3::Bucket)`, and
 *    JSON escaping keeps an embedded `"` from faking the closing quote.
 *    Conditional on purpose: every legitimate value survives sanitization
 *    unchanged AND is a plain identifier, so it renders exactly as it always
 *    did -- no fixture, no unit pin and no operator's grep changes, and only a
 *    value that could spoof gains quotes.
 *
 *    THE IDENTITY HALF IS NOT REDUNDANT WITH THE ALLOWLIST, and omitting it was
 *    a live spoof (issue #3164 review): `displaySafe` maps every
 *    non-printable-ASCII character to a space and then TRIMS, so padding is
 *    ERASED before the `PLAIN_IDENT` test ever runs. A planted
 *    `cdkd/ProdStack /us-east-1/state.json` -- one trailing space -- therefore
 *    tested as plain, rendered UNQUOTED, and printed byte-identical to the
 *    genuine `ProdStack` in `us-east-1`; `listStacks` keys its dedupe on the
 *    `(stackName, region)` PAIR — injectively since go-to-k/cdkd#3323, by a
 *    separator before it — so both refs survive to the output and a
 *    `sort -u`-ing consumer collapses them. What matters to THIS note is only

 *    against the raw text closes the class at its root rather than per padding
 *    character. `src/state/lock-contention-message.ts` reached the same rule
 *    first, for the same reason.
 *
 * A caller comparing the result against the input (the `--orphan <id>` remedy
 * prints its id only when this function is the identity on it) inherits all
 * three: a quoted, cut or fallback rendering is never pasted as a command
 * argument.

  // `truncateCodePoints` slices, so a cap at or below `-length` yields the
  // EMPTY string and the value collapses to `""` (the withheld count stays
  // accurate throughout -- that part was never wrong). `Math.floor` matters
  // only for `0 < cap < 1`, where an unfloored `slice(0, 0.5)` is also empty.
  //
  // `Infinity` deliberately takes the DEFAULT rather than meaning "no cap": a
  // caller asking for no cap gets 255 and a cut, which is the opposite of the
  // intent -- recorded rather than silently reinterpreted, since no caller
  // passes one and guessing which way they meant it is how a display helper
  // acquires a second contract.

/**
 * The shape a state-key segment must have before it may be interpolated into a
 * command cdkd invites an operator to PASTE.
 *
 * An ALLOW-LIST, and deliberately so: the first cut of this predicate was a
 * deny-list that refused a leading `-`, and review defeated it with a leading
 * `~`. A deny-list has to enumerate every character a shell treats specially
 * BEFORE cdkd sees the word, and the set of things nobody thought of is
 * unbounded. The repo already settled this once — `rollback-executor.ts`'s
 * `PASTEABLE_LOGICAL_ID` is `/^[A-Za-z0-9]{1,255}$/`, with a comment naming
 * `~user` and `=x` by name.
 *
 * This one is wider than that because the values here are not logical ids: a
 * cdkd state record's stack name carries `~` (a nested-stack child is minted
 * `${parent}~${logicalId}`) and a region carries `-`. What it keeps from the
 * precedent is the LEADING character, which is where the danger is. MEASURED
 * in bash on a real host rather than reasoned:
 *
 *     ~root        -> /var/root        ~/x  -> $HOME/x       ~-  -> $OLDPWD
 *     a=~/x        -> a=$HOME/x
 *     Parent~Child -> inert            a:~/x -> inert
 *
 * So `~` is dangerous only in the leading position or straight after `=`,
 * which is why a medial `~` stays in the set and `=` stays out of it entirely.
 * A leading digit or letter also closes the option case: `--state-bucket=x`
 * cannot match, and that one is NOT about shell quoting — it is still an
 * OPTION after quoting, which is why the answer is refusal rather than quoting.
