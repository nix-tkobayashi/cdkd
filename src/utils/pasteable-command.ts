/**
 * The way cdkd builds a `cdkd ...` command it tells an operator to PASTE.
 *
 * DERIVE its callers rather than reading a number here — `grep -rln
 * 'pasteableCommand(' src/` is the census, and the one this sentence used to
 * carry went stale twice in one PR, most recently when a site moved to
 * `commandHole`. The CATEGORIES it does not cover yet are at the end of this
 * header — categories, not a census, for the same reason: the population is
 * what go-to-k/cdkd#3436's greps return against the tree of the day, and a
 * list here would be read as complete.
 *
 * go-to-k/cdkd#3363 measured the class this module closes, and
 * [#3436](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/3436) records it repo-wide.
 * Three shapes, each of which a per-site discipline kept re-introducing:
 *
 * 1. **A command inside prose quotes.** `drop it whole with '<command>'` puts
 *    the command in a `'...'` span, so an interpolated value carrying `'`
 *    CLOSES that wrapper when the span is pasted WITH its quotes and the rest
 *    runs as shell: `'cdkd state orphan S --state-bucket 'b; printf X; #''`
 *    printed `X`. Quoting the value does not help — the wrapper is what
 *    inverts. So a command is printed UNWRAPPED on its own labelled line, and
 *    this module returns the text for exactly that.
 *
 *    **UNWRAPPED always; LAST only when the message prints ONE command.** A
 *    message offering a READ and a DESTRUCTIVE template prints one command per
 *    LINE, and there the read ends a line while the TEMPLATE is last — the
 *    rule `.claude/rules/state-malformed-containers.md` states for
 *    go-to-k/cdkd#3516, and a shape this module already serves twice:
 *    `deploy-engine.ts`'s `Inspect it with:` / `Drop the record with:` pair,
 *    and `destroy-runner.ts`'s through `hintFor`. In both, the read command is
 *    correctly NOT last. Collapsing such a pair onto one line is the defect
 *    that rule names: the read must end a line, and the template must be last
 *    with no substituted value after it.
 * 2. **A bare `<placeholder>`.** `<name>` is two redirections, not a word:
 *    `<name` reads stdin from a file and `>` truncates whatever word follows.
 *    {@link commandHole} quotes it, so it pastes as one literal argument.
 * 3. **A value whose quote context the PROSE already flipped.** An English
 *    apostrophe earlier in the sentence (`this stack's name`) opens a shell
 *    quote that closes at the value's own opening quote, leaving the value
 *    bare. This module cannot reach that one — a value in prose is not a
 *    command — which is why the rule it belongs to is "a shell-quoted value
 *    goes on a labelled trailing line, never inside a sentence", and why
 *    deleting apostrophes is NOT the remedy (the next sentence re-opens it).
 *
 * What this module owns is the ARGUMENT side of shape 1 and shape 2: every
 * user-controlled value is sanitized, gated on rendering EXACTLY, and either
 * shell-quoted or replaced by a quoted hole. A value sanitizing would ALTER is
 * never printed in its altered spelling — that addresses a DIFFERENT record
 * than the message means — and never silently dropped, which would resolve the
 * ambient default instead.
 *
 * {@link shellQuote} and {@link commandHole} live here rather than in
 * `../state/lock-contention-message.js`, which still re-exports them for its
 * own callers: `src/utils/**` imports nothing from `src/state/**`, so the
 * shared helper could not reach them the other way round.
 *
 * ## The CATEGORIES not covered yet, as of go-to-k/cdkd#3436's first half
 *
 * Re-derive the members with that issue's greps rather than trusting a list:
 * these are kinds of site, and each kind has more members than the examples.
 *
 * - **Its own copy of the gate.** `buildForceUnlockCommand`
 *   (`state/lock-contention-message.ts`), the `cdkd orphan` properties refusal
 *   (`state/malformed-resources-bag.ts`), `orphanCommandFor` (`cli/commands/
 *   export.ts`), and others in `deployment/deploy-engine.ts` and
 *   `deployment/rollback-executor.ts` (`cli/commands/gc.ts` left this list in
 *   go-to-k/cdkd#3436's second half). They behave the same way; they are not
 *   this function, so a rule change reaches them only by hand.
 * - **A command in prose quotes with a RAW value**, outside the modules
 *   migrated here — `provisioning/providers/**` (Route 53, DynamoDB),
 *   `cli/config-loader.ts` and `cli/commands/orphan.ts` are where the greps land
 *   today.
 *
 * Three entries left this list in go-to-k/cdkd#3613 and saying so is the point:
 * the `cdkd drift` sites of
 * [#3307](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/3307) ALL build through this
 * function now and `drift.ts`'s own `stackCommandFor` is gone; the S3 Tables
 * provider's raw-value prose was fixed there too; and a bare-`<hole>` synopsis
 * is no longer uncovered, because the source fence that finds that shape
 * EXISTS — `scripts/check-pasteable-command-shapes.ts`, whose unit test is its
 * enforcement. A list of what is not yet covered goes stale the moment
 * something is, so derive it rather than reading it: the fence reports the
 * shapes, and its `EXEMPTIONS` (empty today) name any site deliberately left
 * for a follow-up PR.

/**
 * The sentence for a name `pasteableCommand` would not print, rendered from the
 * REASON it gave rather than from a predicate of this site's own — M11 of the
 * go-to-k/cdkd#3499 review. Keying it on a second predicate got both directions
 * wrong at once: `Old;Stack` renders exactly, so a rendering-based clause called
 * a command that names it "not exact", and `--all` also renders exactly, so the
 * same clause said nothing above a hole the operator was then invited to fill
 * with the name printed beside it.
 *
 * SCOPE: the sentence is about a STATE RECORD's name — it opens "This record's
 * name" and ends by pointing at `cdkd state list --long` — so it fits a caller
 * whose value names a state record and nothing else. Every live caller does:
 * the legacy-key migrate refusals in `drift.ts` and `state.ts`, and
 * `state orphan`'s `Destroy with:` warning, whose positional must equal a
 * record's stack name. A caller naming anything else needs its own sentence,
 * not this one with a different verb.
 *
 * WHICH reasons are reachable is the CALLER's question, not this function's,
 * and every arm is answered here because the gate can return any of them. For
 * a name that comes from an S3 key segment — `state refresh-observed`'s legacy
 * refusal and `drift`'s — four of the six are reachable and two are bounded
 * out by the key itself:
 *
 * - `altered`, `option-shaped` and `pattern-shaped` are all reachable: a
 *   planted key can spell a name any of those ways in a handful of bytes.
 * - `not-plain` is reachable only from a caller passing `plainIdent` —
 *   `drift`'s site (M17 of the go-to-k/cdkd#3613 review) and every `state.ts`
 *   caller (go-to-k/cdkd#3696) — and there it is the reason for
 *   every name the five arms above admit but `isPasteableIdent` refuses:
 *   `$(printf INJECTED)`, or a padded name spelling a labelled line.
 * - `empty` is not. `listStacks` drops a key whose stack segment is empty
 *   (`s3-state-backend.ts`'s `if (!stackName) continue`), so `target.stackName`
 *   is non-empty by the time the refusal is built.
 * - `too-long` is not either, and the bound is not obvious: the cap is
 *   `STACK_REF_MAX_CODE_POINTS` (1152), while S3 caps the WHOLE key at 1024
 *   bytes, leaving at most 1008 for the name inside `cdkd/<name>/state.json`.
 *   A multi-byte character only lowers the code-point count further, so a name
 *   arriving through `listStacks` can never reach the cap.
 *
 * Both unreachable arms stay, and are covered, because the REASON is the
 * gate's and not this site's: `pasteableCommand` can return either to a caller
 * whose value comes from somewhere else. A missing arm is no longer a silent
 * fall-through — the `switch` below is exhaustive over `WithholdReason`, so
 * dropping one is a compile error (M13). What the cases buy on top of that is
 * the SENTENCE: the type checker knows an arm exists, not that it says the
 * right thing, and substituting one arm's text for another's is exactly the
