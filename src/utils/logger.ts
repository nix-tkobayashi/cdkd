/**
 * Whether stdout has been claimed by a machine-readable payload.
 *
 * Issue [#2230](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2230). `info` and
 * `debug` resolve to `console.info` / `console.debug`, which write to
 * STDOUT — the same stream a `--json` command prints its payload on. A
 * command whose remediation path logs a status line therefore hands a pipe
 * consumer prose wrapped around the document, and the failure is silent in
 * the worst direction: the human sees correct-looking output while the
 * parser sees a syntax error, or succeeds against a truncated read.
 *
 * MODULE-LEVEL rather than an instance field on purpose. The decision is a
 * property of the PROCESS's stdout, not of one logger object: `child()`
 * hands out fresh {@link ChildLogger} instances (`role-arn`, the state
 * backend, ...) that would each need the flag set individually, and those
 * are exactly the loggers a command cannot reach from its own file.
 *
 * OPT-IN, and deliberately not derived from a `--json` flag inside the
 * logger: nothing changes for a command that does not call
 * {@link reserveStdoutForPayload}. Every `--json` surface keeps its payload
 * stream clean one way or the other, but NOT all by this mechanism, and the
 * count is easy to state one short: SEVEN call this — `cdkd drift`'s original
 * call, plus the six issue
 * [#2280](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2280) added to it (`cdkd
 * list`, `cdkd events`, and the four `cdkd state {list,resources,show,info}`
 * subcommands) — while `cdkd diff` predates the mechanism and demotes the
 * logger to `warn` instead, which SUPPRESSES its info-level lines rather than
 * moving them. Do not read "every `--json` surface" as "every `--json`
 * surface calls this". Of those seven, TWO no longer consult `--json` at all
 * — see the next paragraph, which owns them.
 *
 * A `--json` flag is NOT what makes a stream a payload stream, though, and
 * issue [#2410](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2410) plus issue
 * [#2435](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2435) are the FIVE commands
 * where it is not involved at all: `cdkd synth` (the template), `cdkd list`
 * in EVERY mode (the YAML and the one-id-per-line spellings, not just
 * `--json`), `cdkd state list` in EVERY mode (the one-`Stack (region)`-
 * per-line spelling as much as `--json`; `--long` / `--tree` are formatted
 * views swept along, since the reservation is taken before the mode is
 * known), `cdkd local invoke` (the function response) and `cdkd local
 * invoke-agentcore` (the agent response). NOTE `cdkd list` AND `cdkd state
 * list` each appear in BOTH paragraphs and are ONE call site apiece, not two:
 * go-to-k/cdkd#2280 added both under `--json`, and go-to-k/cdkd#2410 /
 * go-to-k/cdkd#2435 respectively made those same calls unconditional. Ten
 * commands call this in total, not twelve. Those five call it
 * UNCONDITIONALLY at command entry, so for them the DEFAULT human output
 * contract is the one that moved — deliberately, and documented per command
 * in `docs/cli-reference.md`. The OTHER three `cdkd state` subcommands keep
 * the `--json` gate on the discriminator that page states: their flagless
 * output is a formatted human VIEW with no record-set mode behind it, not a
 * line-oriented RECORD SET. What has NOT changed is that the decision stays
 * with the command: a command whose stdout is a human surface (`cdkd deploy`,
 * `cdkd local start-api`, `cdkd local run-task`) still never calls this.

 * `src/utils/docker-cmd.ts` — `spawnStreaming`, which mirrors a child's
 * stdout live under `--verbose`, and `spawnForeground`, which hands the
 * child our fd 1 outright. Issue
 * [#2410](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2410) routed both to stderr
 * while a command holds the reservation.
 *
 * The class is NOT closed, and saying so is the point: `streamLogs` in
 * `src/local/docker-runner.ts` is a third member — it pipes the CONTAINER's
 * stdout into ours on `cdkd local invoke` — and is deliberately NOT
 * converted, because unlike docker's own diagnostics a container's stdout
 * may BE what the user wants on that stream. That needs a per-caller
 * contract decision and a real-Docker integ round, tracked as
 * [#2419](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2419).
 *
 * That is the ONLY shape this predicate is for. A COMMAND must never branch
 * on it — a command's own prose already flows through the logger, so
 * consulting this would be a second copy of a decision `emit` already makes,
 * and the two would drift. If you are reaching for it from a `commands/`
 * file, the answer is `reserveStdoutForPayload()` instead.

  /**

   * line into the buffer so it can be flushed as one atomic block when the
   * stack finishes. Otherwise fall through to the live renderer / console
   * as before.
   *
   * `warn` / `error` already go to stderr via `console.warn` / `console.error`.
   * `info` / `debug` go to stdout — and JOIN them on stderr while
   * {@link stdoutReservedForPayload} is set, so the reserving command's payload
   * is the only thing on stdout.
   *
   * KNOWN GAP, latent and deliberately not restructured (issues
   * [#2230](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2230) and
   * [#2410](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2410)): the stack-output
   * buffer short-circuits ABOVE the reservation check, so a line captured under
   * `runStackBuffered` is replayed by whatever flushes the buffer and never
   * consults the reservation at all. Unreachable today — `deploy.ts`'s
   * `runStackBuffered` call is the only thing that opens a buffer, and `deploy`
   * reserves nothing (its stdout is a human surface). A bare line number here
   * would go stale on the next edit to that file with nothing noticing, so it
   * is named by symbol instead. Because the path is unreachable, a fix would
   * be untestable and would have to guess where the flush should route.
   *
   * That rationale survives #2410 unchanged, and it is worth restating WHY,
   * because #2410 widened the reserving population from a `--json`-only set to
   * one that includes commands with no flag at all. The four it added —
   * `cdkd synth`, `cdkd list`, `cdkd local invoke`,
   * `cdkd local invoke-agentcore` — and the fifth issue
   * [#2435](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2435) then added,
   * `cdkd state list`, run NO work inside `runStackBuffered`:
   * buffering exists for the parallel multi-stack deploy path, which none of
   * them enters. So the gap stays latent, and the condition for it becoming
   * REAL is unchanged in substance but wider in reach: it is no longer "a
   * `--json` command runs work inside `runStackBuffered`" but "ANY reserving
   * command does". Whoever does that must route the flush, not just call
   * {@link reserveStdoutForPayload}.
