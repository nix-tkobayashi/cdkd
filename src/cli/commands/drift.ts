/**
 * Why cdkd did not compare every property a resource records.
 *
 * Carried by the {@link DriftOutcome} `notCompared` variant, and by a `drifted`
 * outcome whose reported changes are real but are not the whole comparison.
 *
 * ONE ENUMERATION rather than the pre-#2135 pair of booleans
 * (`referencesUnresolved`, the OR of both causes, plus `comparisonRefused` for
 * the first one alone). The two flags answered the same question at two widths,
 * and the width is what the EXIT CODE turns on:
 *
 *   - `refused` — cdkd DELIBERATELY REFUSED to resolve this resource's dynamic
 *     references (issue #2108). True exactly when
 *     `resolveStateSecretExpressions` THREW. This is the population the exit
 *     code is scoped to: it is what this change created, it is actionable (spell
 *     the reference as a full ARN, which names its region), and pre-#2108 the
 *     same resources exited `1` because the wrong-region resolution reported
 *     phantom drift — so a non-zero exit PRESERVES what CI consumers had.
 *   - `unresolvedToken` — a `{{resolve:...}}` token simply survived the pass:
 *     a spelling cdkd resolves for NOBODY. Until issue #2482 that was
 *     `{{resolve:ssm-secure:...}}`, a large PRE-EXISTING population; it now
 *     resolves like `ssm`, so no CloudFormation service lands here and what
 *     remains is text that merely looks like a reference (or a service AWS
 *     adds later). The argument is unchanged: the cause is unrelated to #2108
 *     and permanent by construction, so it can never clear on a re-run.
 *     Driving the exit code off it would make `cdkd drift` exit non-zero
 *     forever, in CI, for every one of those users, over a defect this change
 *     did not introduce — the same "permanently non-zero" hazard
 *     `docs/cli-reference.md` already cites as a reason NOT to report an
 *     absent write-only credential as drift.
 *
 * So the split is: as INFORMATION both causes mean the resource was not fully
 * compared, and the `--json` `notCompared` roll-up / the human `PARTIALLY
 * compared` block cover both unchanged. Only the EXIT CODE — the thing CI keys
 * on — is confined to `refused`.
 *
 *   - `readFailed` — the per-resource READ or COMPARISON threw, so no
 *     comparison happened at all (issues
 *     [#2151](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2151) and
 *     [#1945](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1945)). Unlike the two
 *     causes above this one is not about dynamic references: it covers an SDK
 *     or Cloud Control readback that rejected, a provider-authored bag the
 *     normalizers threw on, and a `calculateResourceDrift` that could not walk
 *     the two bags. It joins `refused` on the EXIT CODE side, because the
 *     realistic population is actionable and CLEARABLE — a least-privilege role
 *     missing `cloudcontrol:GetResource`, a throttle, a provider bug — which is
 *     exactly the property `unresolvedToken` lacks. The one population that is
 *     permanent by construction, a type with NO Cloud Control READ handler, is
 *     deliberately NOT routed here: it reports `unsupported`, which is what it
 *     already reported when the same condition arrived as an `undefined` return
 *     instead of a throw. See `isNoReadHandlerError`.
 *
 * A resource hitting BOTH causes is `refused`: that is the wider signal of the
 * two, and it is what the pre-#2135 `comparisonRefused = secretResolutionFailed`
 * said for the same resource. `readFailed` cannot coincide with either: it is
 * raised from a catch that ABANDONS the resource, so no outcome carrying it ever
 * reaches the code that computes the other two.

 *     resource cdkd did not fully compare is a `notCompared` outcome, never a
 *     `clean` one, so "clean" cannot mean anything but "compared and matched".
 *   - `notCompared` — nothing drifted, but cdkd did not compare every property
 *     the resource records, so "no drift" is not a clean bill of health.
 *   - `unsupported` — the provider does not implement `readCurrentState`
 *     yet (the optional method returned `undefined`). Reported separately
 *     so users see what's still uncovered.
 *   - `skipped` — drift detection is not conceptually applicable (see the

 *
 * Issue [#2135](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2135) is why
 * `notCompared` is a MEMBER rather than a `clean` carrying a boolean rider.
 * Under the flag shape every consumer had to REMEMBER to consult the flag, and
 * the default behaviour of forgetting was to report a resource cdkd never
 * checked as one with no drift. That happened twice on the #2108 lane in
 * successive review rounds — round 1: `--json` reported such a resource as plain
 * `clean`; round 2: the exit code read the refusal as a pass — and the third
 * consumer would have been whichever one got written next. As a MEMBER, a
 * consumer that does not name it does not COMPILE: every consumer routes its
 * outcomes through {@link matchOutcome}, whose handler record is a mapped type

 * the same exit code rather than a fourth one, and the name now states the
 * CONDITION rather than one of its causes.
 *
 * SCOPED TO THE CLEARABLE CAUSES, not to everything the report calls
 * `notCompared`. The roll-up also contains resources whose only problem is a
 * surviving `{{resolve:...}}` token cdkd resolves for nobody — a look-alike
 * spelling, since issue #2482 moved `ssm-secure` onto the `ssm` path — which
 * can never clear on a re-run, and which this change did not create. Exiting
 * non-zero for them would break `cdkd drift` in CI forever over an unrelated
 * defect, so the exit reads `refused` and `readFailed` while the report covers
 * all three. See `NotComparedCause` and `outcomeExitSignal`.
 *
 * WHY A NON-ZERO EXIT, and why it is a PRESERVATION rather than a new signal.
 * Pre-#2108 that population resolved the reference in the WRONG region, the
 * baseline could never equal what AWS held, and the resource was reported
 * `drifted` -- so `cdkd drift` exited 1 and every CI gate keyed on the exit code
 * fired. #2108 correctly stopped comparing against a foreign region's plaintext,
 * which made the same population report `notCompared`; without this the
 * command would exit 0 and print `no drift detected` for a stack whose
 * secret-bearing properties were never looked at. Round 1 of that change
 * surfaced the refusal in `--json` (`notCompared`) and in the human report,
 * but the exit code -- the
 * signal most CI gates actually read -- still said "pass".
 *
 * WHY EXIT 2 RATHER THAN 1. `2` is this repo's established "work completed but
 * something was SKIPPED" code (`cdkd destroy` / `cdkd deploy` / `cdkd rollback`,
 * and this command's own `--revert` partial failure), and the three outcomes are
 * genuinely distinct: nothing drifted and everything was compared (0), drift was
 * detected (1), nothing drifted but the comparison was incomplete (2). Drift
 * WINS when both hold -- a drifted resource is the stronger, actionable signal
 * and keeps exiting 1 exactly as it does today.
 *
 * SCOPE: detection-only mode. `--accept` / `--revert` keep their documented exit
 * codes (an `--accept` that refuses a secret-bearing property still exits 0, and
 * a partially-failed `--revert` still exits 2 through `PartialFailureError`) --
 * those modes report per-resource refusals on their own paths, and changing them
 * would alter what a remediation run means, which is not what this closes.
 * Issue [#2208](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2208) re-examined that
 * scoping and KEPT it: what those modes owed was not this exit code but an
 * honest SENTENCE, since their no-drift line claimed a clean bill of health for
 * a stack they had not read. See {@link incompleteRemediationMessage}.
 *
 * WHAT DOES NOT TRIGGER IT: a stack whose properties carry a `{{resolve:...}}`

 * being quietly reassuring. So `skipped` is COUNTED there, and #323's substance
 * is preserved a different way: it is reported under a heading that makes no

 *
 * MESSAGE-ONLY, and the EXIT CODE deliberately stays `0`. The remediation
 * modes' exit codes are a documented user contract -- #2108 scoped its `2` to
 * detection-only mode on purpose, and {@link DriftComparisonIncompleteError}'s
 * note says why: "changing them would alter what a remediation run means".
 * Nothing about that reasoning expired. The defect this closes is entirely in
 * what the run REPORTS: `--accept` / `--revert` already correctly leave an
 * uncompared resource alone (both iterate the drifted outcomes only, asserted
 * in `tests/unit/cli/drift-per-resource-failure.test.ts`), so the state and AWS
 * are right and only the sentence is wrong. Making the remediation path exit
 * non-zero would break the CI of everyone running `cdkd drift --accept` over a
 * stack that hits a throttle, to fix a wording problem.
 *
 * What the lines have to carry, since the exit code will not carry it: that the
 * comparison was INCOMPLETE (never that no drift was detected), HOW MANY
 * resources were not compared and WHY, WHICH of those cdkd is actually
 * uncertain about, and the pointer to the detection-only run, which is the mode
 * whose exit code does report it (`2`).
 *
 * THE TRIGGER AND THE COUNT ARE DIFFERENT POPULATIONS, deliberately, and
 * collapsing them is the defect review round 1 found here.
 *
 *   - The TRIGGER is `anyIncomplete`, i.e. {@link outcomeExitSignal}'s
 *     `incomplete`. It is narrow on purpose: a stack whose ONLY uncompared
 *     resource holds a `{{resolve:...}}` token cdkd resolves for nobody must
 *     not start shouting on every run about a comparison no action of the
 *     user's can ever complete -- the same CI-forever hazard that cause is
 *     kept out of the exit code on.
 *   - The COUNT and the LABELS, once the line is triggered, cover EVERY
 *     uncompared resource, each named by its own reason (see
 *     {@link uncomparedTally}). A resource that was not compared was not
 *     compared, whatever the reason, and counting only the clearable ones
 *     printed `1 of 3` on a stack the report a few lines above called
 *     `2 resource(s) NOT fully compared` -- two lines disagreeing about one
 *     run, with the newer and quieter one being the one written to stop a
 *     command from being quietly reassuring.
 *
 * WHAT `N` AND `M` ARE, stated because the alternatives are all defensible and
 * silence about the choice is what made the first cut wrong. `M` is the total
 * number of resource outcomes, and `N` is every one of them that was not
 * compared -- so `unsupported` and `skipped` land in `N`, WITH their own
 * phrase, rather than sitting only in the denominator where they would inflate
 * `M` and go unnamed. On a remediation path, erring LOUD is the correct
 * direction. Note this makes `N` deliberately WIDER than the report's
 * `NOT fully compared` heading, which counts the reference / read population
 * only and reports `drift unknown` separately: the question this line answers
 * is #2154's, "was everything actually compared", not "how many entries are in
 * that block". What being in `N` does NOT buy is a uniform claim about the
 * resource -- see {@link UNCOMPARED_REASONS}'s `kind`, and see
 * {@link UncomparedReason} for why counting a `skipped` resource here is not a
 * reversal of #323's silence.

 *
 * One instance per STACK, not per resource and not per op — the resolved-value

 * it turns on is whether a RE-RUN CAN CLEAR IT. A type Cloud Control has no READ

 * make `cdkd drift` exit non-zero forever for every stack holding one -- the
 * same "unclearable in CI" hazard `unresolvedToken` is kept out of the exit code
 * for. It reports `unsupported` instead, which is not a new claim about it:
 * `CloudControlProvider.readCurrentState` signals the SAME condition by
 * returning `undefined` when the response carries no properties, and that
 * already reports `unsupported`. Which spelling arrives is AWS's choice, so the
 * two must not produce different outcomes.
 *
 * Matches on `name`, and WALKS THE CAUSE CHAIN rather than reading the top level
 * only. Be precise about why, because the obvious justification is wrong:
 * `CloudControlProvider.readCurrentState` re-throws everything but
 * `ResourceNotFoundException` RAW and never routes through that class's
 * `handleError`, so on today's code the only shape reaching here is the bare SDK
 * error -- which is what #2151 measured live, and which the top-level `name`
 * alone would catch.
 *
 * The walk is therefore for a wrap that does not exist YET, and it is cheap
 * insurance rather than dead code: `handleError` already recognizes this exact
 * pair and preserves the original as `cause`, so the day any read path is routed
 * through it -- or wrapped by a caller -- the top-level name becomes
 * `ProvisioningError` and a name-only check would silently start reporting a
 * permanent no-read-path condition as an actionable failure, at exit 2, forever.
 * A reader deleting the walk as unreachable should know that is the failure they
 * are buying.
 *
 * The message check is a FALLBACK for a re-wrap that kept neither the name nor
 * the cause, and it is deliberately the full phrase rather than `does not
 * support`: matching loosely would route a genuine read failure to `unsupported`
 * and exit 0 over a resource nobody compared, which is the direction this whole

 * State stores the unresolved EXPRESSION — that is the GHSA-p5qg-v9gv-hc7w
 * redaction — while a provider's `readCurrentState` snapshot necessarily holds
 * the resolved PLAINTEXT, because that is what AWS was given at deploy time.
 * Nothing in `cdkd drift` reconciled the two, and all three of the command's
 * modes broke on it: the comparison reported permanent phantom drift and
 * printed the plaintext as the AWS-current side, `--accept` persisted that
 * plaintext back into `state.json`, and `--revert` shipped the literal
 * `{{resolve:...}}` string to the live resource.
 *
 * The counterpart of the rollback replay's `resolveReplayProps`
 * (`src/deployment/rollback-executor.ts`), and for the same reason: both
 * commands are synth-free, so the expression string in the persisted record is
 * the only thing there is to resolve from. Every plaintext is recorded into
 * `secrets` so the caller can redact it back out of anything it PRINTS or
 * PERSISTS, and every path that produced one into `secretPaths` so the caller
 * can act on a value it does NOT recognise there — see {@link redactDriftChanges}.
 *
 * A `{{resolve:...}}` token that SURVIVES the pass is reported through
 * `onUnresolved` and left in place — it is not an error. The resolver's
 * unsupported-service arm warns and returns the literal (`ssm-secure:` was the
 * live example until issue #2482 gave it an arm; what reaches it now is text
 * that merely looks like a reference), and `cdkd deploy` resolves through the
 * very same code, so AWS is ALREADY holding that literal string and state
 * records it. Replaying it is therefore a correct no-op, and failing the
 * resource over it would take every other drifted property on that resource
 * down with it (plus exit 2). The report exists so the user learns cdkd is
 * shipping a token it cannot resolve, which is a real thing to know and not a
 * reason to stop.

 * worse than either behaviour on its own.
 *
 * Three refusals, all about a value cdkd could not identify rather than about

 *
 * - A masked VALUE says AWS holds something at a known-secret path that is not
 *   what the reference resolves to. Writing `***` would corrupt the baseline
 *   and make the next deploy push the literal mask at AWS.
 * - A masked PATH says the readback answered with a map KEYED by a secret.
 *   `setAtPath` would then create a key literally named `***` — and when
 *   `awsValue` is `undefined` it would INSERT that key rather than removing the
 *   real one, so the value check alone does not cover it.
 * - A masked BASELINE (issue #2274) says the state side itself is the mask —
 *   a `NoEcho` custom resource's `Data` redacted out of `state.json`. Accepting
 *   would write the live plaintext over a deliberate redaction, which is the
 *   opposite of what the mask is for.
 *
 * The path check is what makes the value exemptions safe: `redactDriftValue`
 * lets `undefined` / `null` / a whole expression through unmasked, which is
 * right for a value and says nothing about the path it sits at.

    // sentence without closing #1981: this command now threads the state key's
    // region as `UpdateContext.expectedRegion`, and a CLOUD-CONTROL-routed
    // resource REFUSES rather than writing through the wrong region's client.
    // SDK-routed resources still write where the ambient clients point, so a
    // cross-region `--all --revert` is now MIXED — refusals for the CC half,
    // the #1981 behaviour for the SDK half.
    //
    // Issue [#2108](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2108) is the third
    // scope note, and it is the one that made this a BAG of resolvers rather
    // than a single one. #1957 fixed which region this resolver READS FOR — the
    // stack's, rather than the ambient CLI one. It did NOT ask whether the
    // stack's own region is the right region for a given EXPRESSION, and for a
    // value that arrived through a cross-region cross-stack import it is not:
    // since #1934 the consumer records the PRODUCER's region-less spelling, so
    // re-resolving it here answered from a same-named secret in the wrong
    // region. `DriftSecretResolvers` routes each reference to the region
    // `classifyReplaySecretRegion` says must answer for it.

      // [#1945](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1945): ONE guard over the
      // whole per-resource body, not a catch per risky call.
      //
      // The defect is a CLASS, not two instances. Everything from here to the
      // outcome push runs provider-authored or AWS-facing code, and a throw from
      // ANY of it propagated out of this loop and out of the command: no summary
      // line, no per-resource report, and every OTHER resource in the stack --
      // and under `--all` every remaining STACK -- left unchecked, over one bad
      // resource. The reachable sites are `provider.readCurrentState`,
      // `ccApiFallback.readCurrentState`, `getDriftUnknownPaths` /
      // `getDriftUnorderedPaths`, `canonicalizePrincipalUniqueIds` (which makes
      // its own `iam:GetRole` call), `canonicalizeIpProtocols`,
      // `provider.canonicalizeDriftProperties`, `calculateResourceDrift` and
      // `redactDriftChanges`. #2151 reported the second, #1945 the seventh; a

      // provider lookup above, the deny-list short-circuit, and (since #1914)

 * compares wholesale and never descends into. Post-revert the ASG kept the
 * capacity provider with its managed scaling silently broken (verified live
 * 2026-08-10).
 *
 * The semantic: the baseline still WINS for every ordinary tag — one it has and
 * AWS lost is re-added, one whose value differs is reset, and a
 * user/console-added tag AWS alone has is still REMOVED. Only a
 * {@link isServiceManagedTagKey} entry survives.
 *
 * **This is the issue's option 2, not its option 1, and the choice was settled
 * by a live test rather than by taste.** Option 1 (revert the whole tag list as
 * a diff, so ANY out-of-band add survives) was implemented first and failed the
 * `drift-revert` integ at its final assertion: that fixture injects an
 * `IntegInjected` tag and requires `--revert` to strip it, i.e. "revert removes
 * a console-added tag" is an established contract with a test behind it.
 * Option 1 would redefine revert semantics for a whole property class — which
 * is exactly the design pass the issue said it needed — so the narrow safeguard
 * ships instead, fixing the reported breakage while leaving ordinary tag revert
 * untouched.
 *
 * Scope: TOP-LEVEL tag lists, which is where `buildRevertNewProperties`
 * operates. A tag list nested inside another property (an EC2 launch template's
 * `TagSpecifications`) still reverts wholesale.
 *
 * Order: baseline entries first in baseline order, then the preserved

 *
 * #1478 shipped the **warn and proceed** semantic — the values were still

 * what the caller does about it.
 *
 * Scoped deliberately:
 *
 * - **Only drifted top-level keys.** Non-drifted keys keep their AWS-current
 *   value in `buildRevertNewProperties`, so nothing under them is at stake.
 * - **Only when `observedProperties` is absent.** With it present the desired
 *   side is the deploy-time AWS snapshot, which already carries AWS-authored
 *   fields — removing one there is a legitimate revert of a real console
 *   change, and reporting it would be noise on every run.
 * - **Only keys that vanish.** A key present on both sides with a different
 *   VALUE is the drift the user asked to revert, and it reverts normally.

 * baseline does not declare (issue
 * [#1626](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1626) items 2 + 3).
 *
 * ## The contract this settles
 *
 * `provider.update(logicalId, physicalId, type, newProperties,
 * previousProperties)` has ONE parameter list and TWO callers:
 *
 * - the deploy engine passes the state-recorded `properties` — the
 *   LAST-DEPLOYED TEMPLATE — so a path present on the previous side and absent
 *   from the desired side means exactly one thing: **the user removed it from
 *   the template**;
 * - `runRevert` passes the FULL `readCurrentState` snapshot, so the same
 *   absence ALSO covers **a path the template never declared at all**.
 *
 * Both provider shapes then destroy that path, by different routes. One that
 * KEY-DIFFS a collection reads the absence as a REMOVAL — ELBv2's
 * `LoadBalancerAttributes`, where `readCurrentState` deliberately emits every
 * attribute AWS reports, puts ~18 untemplated attributes on the removal path
 * against a template declaring one or two. One that REPLACES a bag wholesale
 * (`PutBucketTagging` is documented full-replace; the same holds for every
 * `Put*Configuration`) never consults the previous side at all and simply
 * sends a bag the untemplated path is missing from.
 *
 * That second shape is why the fix lands on the DESIRED side rather than by
 * trimming `previousProperties`: trimming stops the key-diffing removal but
 * leaves the wholesale-replace drop untouched, so half the reported paths
 * would still be erased while the plan claimed otherwise. Merging into the bag
 * cdkd actually SENDS covers both, and is what makes the plan's "left
 * untouched" line true rather than aspirational.
 *
 * ## Scoped to the baseline that cannot tell the two apart
 *
 * Applied ONLY when `observedProperties` is absent — the same gate as
 * {@link findRevertUnbaselinedAwsKeys}'s notice, and for the same reason. With
 * observed-capture present the baseline IS a deploy-time AWS snapshot, so a
 * path AWS reports and the baseline lacks was genuinely added out-of-band and
 * removing it is the revert the user asked for (the `drift-revert` integ
 * fixture requires exactly that for an injected tag). Without it the baseline
 * is the raw TEMPLATE, and "AWS has it, the template does not" is
 * indistinguishable from "AWS authored it" — so the honest answer is to leave
 * it alone. `findRevertUnbaselinedAwsKeys`'s docstring already named this as
 * one of the stricter options #1478 did not foreclose ("treat 'no
 * observedProperties' as 'previous is unknown' so the merge preserves"); this
 * is that option.
 *
 * The structural rules mirror {@link collectMissingPaths} case for case —
 * plain records descend, KEYED `[{Key, Value}]` lists merge by `Key`,
 * positional arrays and scalars are taken from the baseline wholesale — so
 * every path the plan names as preserved IS kept, and a unit test pins that
 * correspondence by diffing the flag-on and flag-off outputs.
 *
 * A service-authored tag is absent from both sides of that comparison and
 * stays consistent: `findRevertUnbaselinedAwsKeys` omits it
 * (`isServiceManagedTagKey`) because the #1501 carve-out already preserves it
 * on the DEFAULT path, so it is not something this flag rescues and reporting
 * it would warn about a loss that cannot happen. The test pins that it
 * survives under BOTH settings.
 *
 * A path the baseline DOES declare always wins, which is what keeps the revert
 * a revert: a drifted value is reset, and one AWS dropped is re-added.

/**
 * Replace every leaf of a revert payload that still holds a `{{resolve:...}}`
 * token with the value AWS currently has at that position (issue #1914).
 *
 * cdkd downgrades an unresolvable reference from a per-resource failure to a
 * warning, on the premise that `cdkd deploy` resolves through the
 * resolver's same unsupported-service arm — so AWS already holds the literal
 * and replaying it is a no-op. **That premise holds only for records cdkd
 * deployed.** A record adopted by `cdkd import --migrate-from-cloudformation`,
 * or one whose position was edited out of band, holds something ELSE there.
 * `diffAt` skips such a leaf, so it never drifts — but
 * `buildRevertNewProperties` overlays the whole top-level subtree when any
 * SIBLING key drifts, which would push the literal token over that value. That
 * is defect 1 of this issue surviving in a narrower case, on a live AWS write.
 *
 * (When this was written the population was `ssm-secure`, which CloudFormation
 * resolves SERVER-side, so a migrated record held the PLAINTEXT on AWS. Since
 * issue #2482 cdkd resolves that spelling itself and the token never reaches
 * this pass; what survives is a spelling nobody resolves, so the live value
 * here is whatever the user or another tool put at that position.)
 *
 * Deciding by PROVENANCE would need a flag state does not carry. Deciding by
 * what AWS actually holds needs nothing and is exact in both directions: for a
 * cdkd-deployed record AWS holds the token, so copying it back is the same
 * no-op the premise described; for any other record AWS holds a value cdkd
 * cannot compare, which is left untouched.
 *
 * Falls back to KEEPING the token wherever AWS has nothing at that position —
 * that is what `cdkd deploy` sends, so it is the safe residual rather than
 * dropping a property the resource may require. Array descent pairs live
 * elements through {@link pairedLiveItems} — an identity field first, else the
 * array's own literal frame corroborated per LEAF — never by blind index
 * (issue [#2893](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2893)): until that
 * issue the descent was positional behind a length test, so a readback AWS
 * REORDERED copied element *i*'s live value into element *i*'s token position
 * and `provider.update` shipped a value belonging to a DIFFERENT element. The
 * wildcard handed to the pairing is "whole token OR the redaction mask": a
 * token leaf cannot corroborate an order (its live counterpart is the resolved
 * value, so comparing would refuse every array this pass exists to serve), and
 * a mask leaf belongs to the SIBLING mask walk but must abstain here rather
 * than contradict. Where the pairing refuses, the token is KEPT — the same
 * residual as everywhere else in this pass, and deliberately NOT the mask
 * walk's drop-the-resource refusal: that one would abandon every other drifted
 * property over an alignment this pass never needed, while the kept token is
 * what `cdkd deploy` sends. The trade this accepts: an array whose OTHER
 * leaves genuinely drifted no longer takes a positional copy (the frame cannot
 * corroborate an order it no longer matches), so the token ships there —
 * a no-op for a record cdkd deployed, and for any other record a preserved
 * pre-existing breakage rather than another element's value written live.

/**
 * Paths in the bag `--revert` is about to send whose value is an unresolved
 * CloudFormation intrinsic OBJECT — `{ Ref: ... }` or a single-key
 * `{ 'Fn::*': ... }` (issue
 * [#2855](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2855)).
 *
 * WHY THE SHAPE IS REACHABLE. `cdkd import`'s warn path persists raw intrinsic
 * objects into a record's `properties`, and issue #2842's baseline refusal is
 * what routes such a record here: it leaves `observedProperties` undefined, so
 * `runRevert`'s `revertBaseline` falls back to the raw bag.
 * `resolveStateSecretExpressions` re-resolves only `{{resolve:...}}` STRINGS,
 * so the OBJECT walks through it untouched, and the drift comparator's
 * `{{resolve:` skip is a string test too — the object simply differs from the
 * readback, drifts, and `buildRevertNewProperties` overlays it into the send
 * bag.
 *
 * WHY IT MUST BE REFUSED rather than shipped or live-preserved. Measured
 * (issue #2855's open question) with mocked SDK clients on both routes: NO
 * route fails loudly on cdkd's side. `SSMParameterProvider.update` puts the
 * raw object straight into `PutParameterCommand.input.Value`;
 * `CloudControlProvider.update` emits it verbatim as a JSON-patch value, and
 * for a `JSON_STRING_PROPERTIES` type (`AWS::Events::Rule.EventPattern`) it is
 * `JSON.stringify`ed into a schema-VALID string — a payload AWS cannot even
 * reject on type, i.e. guaranteed silent corruption. Live-preserving (the
 * token pass's answer) is no better: the intrinsic's real value depends on
 * template context a synth-free command does not have, and copying whatever
 * AWS holds would silently bless an out-of-band edit as the baseline.
 *
 * The predicate mirrors the resolver's own rule (a CloudFormation intrinsic is
 * ALWAYS a single-key object; `detectUnknownIntrinsicKey` in
 * `intrinsic-function-resolver.ts` states why single-key is what keeps a real
 * property literally named `Ref` from false-positiving). A non-plain object
 * (`Date`, `Uint8Array`) cannot be an intrinsic and is not descended. The scan
 * is scoped to `topLevelKeys` — the DRIFTED keys, the only ones
 * `buildRevertNewProperties` sources from the baseline — so a value that
 * merely looks intrinsic under a non-drifted key cannot refuse a revert it
 * never participates in. The caller hands it the BASELINE
 * (`desiredProperties`), never the post-overlay send bag: on the very
 * population this refusal exists for, `mergeUntemplatedValue`'s key-merge can
 * FUSE a single-key intrinsic with a plain-record live value into a multi-key
 * object the predicate no longer matches, while every overlay arm re-emits
 * every baseline path into the send bag in some shape — so the baseline scan
 * is complete where the merged-bag scan was dilutable, and an AWS-echoed
 * lookalike (which lives only in the overlay) stays exempt by construction.
 * The caller additionally gates the whole scan on
 * `observedProperties === undefined` — intrinsic objects reach a revert
 * baseline only through the raw-`properties` fallback, while an
 * `observedProperties` baseline is READBACK-derived, where a single-key map
 * named like an intrinsic is a real AWS value and a refusal would be
 * permanent (the call site's comment carries the full derivation).
 *
 * The whole flagged leaf is reported once; nothing beneath it is separately
 * scanned, since the caller refuses the resource on the first path anyway.

/**
 * The live array to read a preserved leaf's replacement from, aligned to
 * `send`'s indices — or `undefined` when the two lists cannot be aligned at
 * all, which routes every mask beneath them to `unpreservablePaths` in the
 * mask walk and keeps the token in the token walk (see the wildcard
 * paragraph below for the split).
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT INDEX ALIGNMENT ANY MORE (issue
 * [#2884](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2884)). Until issue
 * [#2852](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2852) the only mask in a
 * persisted bag came from a `NoEcho` custom resource's `Data` (issue #2274),
 * which sits at a scalar leaf of a property the template names. #2852 added a
 * second source, and it lands in exactly the population index alignment is
 * WRONG on: a leaf is masked BECAUSE `refuseUncertifiedReadbackPositions` could
 * not pair the two lists — an unkeyed array AWS reordered, or a keyed element
 * whose identity AWS normalised. A resource that produced a mask is by
 * construction one whose list does not come back in a stable order.
 *
 * Traced consequence, which is the issue #1498 / #1501 data-loss class this
 * module's own doc calls "strictly worse than the disclosure": for
 * `Environment: [{Name:'DB_PASS', Value:<ref>}, {Name:'REGION', Value:'...'}]`
 * echoed back case-normalised and reordered, the baseline becomes
 * `[{Name:'REGION',...}, {Name:'***', Value:'***'}]`, and an index-aligned
 * revert copies `live[1]` into the masked slot — shipping a duplicated `REGION`
 * and DELETING the password variable from the live task definition.
 *
 * So the alignment must be one AWS's own reordering cannot break:
 * {@link identityKeyFor} — the same rule the redaction walk pairs by, so the
 * two can never disagree about which elements correspond. It is asked FIRST and
 * with NO length test, which is a change from the first cut of this function: a
 * length test ahead of it refuses a list AWS legitimately ADDED an element to,
 * while the keyed lookup needs no such partner — a `send` element whose identity
 * AWS does not report simply yields no live value, which is already the
 * refusing arm.
 *
 * WITHOUT AN IDENTITY FIELD the array's own literal FRAME has to vouch for the
 * order — the same corroboration `unkeyedArrayPairsByAnchors` requires on the
 * redaction side — and the test is PER-LEAF. Three rules, and the first cut of
 * this function had none of them right:
 *
 * - **the lengths must match**, positional alignment being all that is left;
 * - **every leaf of `send` that is not a mask must equal `live`'s leaf at the
 *   same position** ({@link corroboratedLeafCount}), masked leaves wildcarded.
 *   A whole-ELEMENT exemption is what shipped first, and it corroborated
 *   NOTHING: {@link carriesSecretMask} is a DEEP, whole-subtree test, so an
 *   element carrying one mask anywhere skipped the comparison entirely.
 *   Measured on `[{Pw:'***',Role:'reader'},{Pw:'***',Role:'admin'}]` against a
 *   live list AWS returned in the other order — the admin password was written
 *   onto the reader entry and `provider.update` shipped it;
 * - **at most ONE element may carry a mask, and at least one non-mask leaf must
 *   actually have been COMPARED.** Two masked slots leave the surviving literal
 *   frame unable to say which mask goes where (two secret environment variables
 *   in one container definition is the ordinary shape), and zero compared
 *   leaves is the all-masked array {@link SECRET_MASK} produces when AWS
 *   normalised the identity field too — there the old `every` was vacuously
 *   true and the alignment rested on no evidence at all. With ONE masked slot
 *   and every other position literally equal, the single live element left over
 *   is the only value that can belong there.
 *
 * The `compared > 0` floor DELIBERATELY also refuses a single-element scalar
 * array — `[SECRET_MASK]` against one live value — even though one masked slot
 * against one live slot looks unambiguous. It is unambiguous only IF the live
 * list corresponds to this one, and with zero corroborated leaves the only
 * evidence for that is the length-1 match, which is no evidence: this is the
 * all-masked reading applied to its smallest shape, and the cost is a refusal
 * (the safe residual), not a wrong write. THAT COST SENTENCE IS THE MASK
 * WALK'S ALONE — for the token walk a refusal WRITES the token, so the same
 * floor inverts there and the singleton is accepted instead; see
 * `pairedLiveItems`' `acceptForcedSingleton` for the derivation.
 *
 * THE EVIDENCE MUST NOT BE MANUFACTURED BY A SIBLING PASS. `send` here must be
 * values the caller did not itself copy from `live` — see
 * {@link preserveLiveValuesAtMaskedLeaves}'s `corroborationSource` parameter
 * for the round-4 #2884 defect where the token pass's index-copied live values
 * corroborated their own indices.
 *
 * Refusing is the correct outcome for the MASK caller — it drops the whole
 * resource rather than send a guess. The TOKEN caller's refusal residual is
 * KEEPING the token (see below); both are the refusal `undefined` spells here,
 * and what it costs is the CALLER's contract, not this function's.
 *
 * PARAMETERISED WILDCARDS (issue #2893). This pairing now serves BOTH preserve
 * walks, because the two questions are identical — "which live element belongs
 * to this send element?" — and a second hand-rolled copy of the rule is
 * exactly how the `maskDeep` class of divergence starts. What differs per
 * caller is only WHICH leaf is the one being paired FOR (and so must be
 * wildcarded rather than compared) and what a refusal costs:
 *
 * - the MASK walk wildcards {@link SECRET_MASK} alone; a refusal drops the
 *   resource, so over-refusal is a safe posture there;
 * - the TOKEN walk wildcards a WHOLE `{{resolve:...}}` token (its live
 *   counterpart is the resolved value, so comparing would contradict on every
 *   array that pass exists to serve) AND the mask (owned by the LATER mask
 *   walk — comparing `***` against live would contradict spuriously, and
 *   treating it as evidence would be wrong in the other direction). Its
 *   refusal residual is keeping the token, which `provider.update` ships —
 *   a no-op for a record cdkd deployed, a preserved pre-existing breakage
 *   otherwise, and in both cases better than another element's live value
 *   copied into the wrong position.
 *
 * `carriesWildcard` must be the DEEP form of `wildcardLeaf` (an element
 * carrying a wildcard anywhere is a slot whose alignment part-rests on
 * abstention), and the one-slot bound applies to it: with two such elements
 * the surviving literal frame cannot say which wildcard goes where.
 *
 * `acceptForcedSingleton` (PR #2912 review, blocker 1) is where the two
 * callers' refusal COSTS meet the evidence rules, and it exists because a
 * rule that is sound for one arm BECAUSE of what its refusal costs cannot be
 * shared without re-deriving that cost. At `send.length === 1` against
 * `live.length === 1` no evidence question remains OPEN: the position is
 * FORCED (there is no other candidate to mis-pair with), and a positional
 * copy writes each live value back to its own position, so no
 * cross-POSITION donation — the credential-swap class every bound above
 * exists to stop — is constructible. Cross-IDENTITY donation is: the
 * bypass sits above the identity arm and its wildcard-identity guard, so
 * `[{Name:'DB', Value:<token>}]` against a live `[{Name:'OTHER', Value:'X'}]`
 * ships `{Name:'DB', Value:'X'}` — a value from a differently-identified
 * element. That is position-neutral (X lands at the exact position AWS
 * holds it), it is what the pre-#2893 positional descent did for every such
 * array, and the alternative writes the token over X; the trade is stated
 * here rather than claimed away. What the evidence rules still doubt at
 * 1-vs-1 is only "does this live list correspond to this send list at
 * all", and the two callers answer that doubt oppositely because their
 * refusal residuals invert:
 *
 * - the MASK walk refuses (`false`, the default): its residual is dropping
 *   the resource, so doubt costs a refusal — the safe direction, and the
 *   `[SECRET_MASK]`-vs-one-live-value reading its own doc defends;
 * - the TOKEN walk accepts (`true`): its residual WRITES the literal token
 *   over whatever AWS holds (`provider.update` ships it — the #1914
 *   corruption), so refusing on a forced position DESTROYS the live value a
 *   pairing would have preserved, while accepting is write-neutral even when
 *   the correspondence doubt is real (the copied value lands at the exact
 *   position AWS already holds it). Refusal buys nothing and costs a
 *   destructive write, so the token walk takes the pairing — which is also
 *   exactly the pre-#2893 behaviour for every 1-vs-1 array.
 *
 * The bypass sits ABOVE the identity arm deliberately: at 1-vs-1 an identity
 * mismatch (AWS normalised the one element's Name) changes which EVIDENCE
 * rule fails, not the forced position, and routing it through the identity
 * arm would re-open the same inverted cost through a different door. Every
 * bound below is untouched for `length >= 2`, where mis-pairing is real.

/**
 * Keep `cdkd drift --revert` from pushing a REDACTION MASK to AWS (issue
 * [#2274](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2274)).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. A `NoEcho` custom resource's `Data` resolved into a
 * dependent's property is persisted as {@link SECRET_MASK}, because there is no
 * expression to store in its place. `--revert` pushes the BASELINE to AWS, so
 * without this a revert triggered by a SIBLING key would write the literal
 * `***` onto the live SSM parameter / secret / env var — the issue #1498 /
 * #1501 data-corruption class, and strictly worse than the disclosure the mask
 * exists to prevent. Shipping the mask without this guard would trade one for
 * the other.
 *
 * The sibling of {@link preserveLiveValuesAtUnresolvedTokens} and deliberately
 * a SEPARATE function rather than another branch inside it. That one is gated
 * on `unresolvedTokens.size > 0` at its call site, and this hazard is decided
 * by the SEND bag alone — a resource can carry a mask with no unresolved token
 * anywhere, so folding the two would put this check behind a condition that has
 * nothing to do with it.
 *
 * IT REGISTERS WHAT IT MOVES, exactly as the sibling does, and an earlier
 * revision's reason for not doing so was wrong: it said "the live value is one
 * cdkd never resolved and cannot recognise, so there is no needle to record".
 * The needle is `liveValue -> {@link SECRET_MASK}`, i.e. a MASK-ONLY entry, and
 * the evidence for it is the position — the masked position proves the value
 * is ONE CDKD CHOSE TO MASK, since nothing but this module's own redaction
 * puts a mask at a leaf. That is deliberately weaker than "proof the value is
 * secret" (issue #2881): a #2852 fail-closed mask deliberately over-masks a
 * value the walk merely could not certify — a normalised `US-EAST-1` as
 * readily as a credential — so the live value registered here may be an
 * ordinary literal. The consequence is bounded to over-masking log output,
 * the safe direction, and registering it is still right: when the position
 * DOES hold a secret, the registration is what keeps the moved plaintext out
 * of every reader below. Without it this function copies live plaintext into the
 * send bag and then `collectNarrowedTopLevelKeys` persists that delta into
 * `observedProperties` against a `secrets` map holding no entry for it — the
 * same disclosure the mask exists to prevent, arriving through the mechanism
 * that is supposed to protect it — and the same omission un-masks it in
 * `maskSecretsInText(err.message, secrets)` and in the masker handed to
 * `provider.update`.
 *
 * `secrets` is therefore MUTATED, which is why it is a parameter rather than
 * something the caller could omit. `recordMaskOnlyValue` applies its own
 * refusals (an entry that already carries a real EXPRESSION wins; a plaintext
 * below the needle floor is not recorded), so this call site states only the
 * position fact and lets the module decide what is registrable.
 *
 * TWO OUTCOMES per masked leaf, and the second is why this returns a report
 * rather than just a bag:
 *
 * - AWS holds a value there -> copy the LIVE value in. The revert then leaves
 *   that position exactly as AWS has it while still reverting every other
 *   drifted key, which is the same trade `preserveLiveValuesAtUnresolvedTokens`
 *   makes.
 * - AWS holds nothing there (the position could not be aligned, or the key is
 *   absent live) -> there is no safe value to send, so the path is reported as
 *   UNPRESERVABLE and the caller refuses the whole resource. Sending the mask
 *   would be the corruption; dropping the key would delete a property the
 *   resource may require.
 *
 * Array descent is NOT positional and does NOT bail on a length mismatch —
 * {@link pairedLiveItems} owns that question, for BOTH walks since issue
 * #2893 (the sibling's earlier answer, index alignment behind a length test,
 * was wrong by construction on the population that produces these masks, and
 * wrong under any reordered readback for the sibling's own tokens). An
 * earlier revision of this paragraph still claimed the sibling's rule after
 * the pairing had changed underneath it.
 *
 * `corroborationSource` is the bag the PAIRING EVIDENCE is read from, and it
 * exists because of a round-4 #2884 defect: `runRevert` runs
 * {@link preserveLiveValuesAtUnresolvedTokens} FIRST, and that pass copies
 * `live` values into whole-token leaves — BY INDEX when the defect was found;
 * by certified pairing since issue #2893, which does not retire this
 * parameter, because a copied leaf is trivially deep-equal to `live` at its
 * own position HOWEVER it was chosen, so corroborating `send` (the post-token
 * bag) against that same `live` still counts evidence a sibling pass
 * manufactured rather than evidence AWS's readback supplied. Under the
 * original index copies, an unkeyed array
 * whose only non-mask leaves were tokens satisfied both the
 * `compared > 0` floor and the one-mask bound on evidence the sibling pass
 * manufactured, and a reordered `live` wrote another element's secret into the
 * masked slot — the credential-swap class the guards were added for. The same
 * fabrication reached the IDENTITY arm: an identity field that was itself a
 * token took its live value by index, and {@link pairedLiveItems}' keyed
 * lookup then "paired" it right back to that index. So the caller passes the
 * PRE-token bag here; both the identity lookup and the per-leaf corroboration
 * run over values no sibling pass copied from `live`, a token leaf compares
 * against the resolved live value and CONTRADICTS (its live counterpart is
 * unknowable, and an abstention would make token leaves unbounded wildcards
 * beside the deliberately bounded one-mask rule), and the array refuses. The
 * masked VALUES the walk writes still come from `send` — only the evidence
 * source changes. Defaults to `send` (self-corroboration, the pre-round-4
 * behaviour) for a caller with no sibling pass; a structural mismatch between
 * the two bags refuses the masks beneath it rather than falling back to the
 * fabricable bag. Until issue #2920 the token pass COULD produce one, by
 * returning the live CONTAINER AWS holds over a whole-token string leaf; it
 * now copies only a string, so no sibling pass produces the mismatch today.
 * The refusal is KEPT as a deliberate fail-closed cost rather than retired on
 * that reachability argument: a bag that disagrees with its evidence source is
 * exactly where falling back would hand the fabricable bag back.
 *
 * Returns the input bag BY IDENTITY when it holds no mask — checked FIRST via
 * {@link carriesSecretMask}, so a mask-free revert (the ordinary case) pays
 * one boolean walk instead of a full rebuild plus per-array pairing.

/**
 * Build the `newProperties` object passed to `provider.update` during
 * `--revert`. Strategy:
 *
 *   1. Start from `awsProperties` (the AWS-current snapshot returned
 *      by `readCurrentState`, which `runRevert` already passes as the
 *      `previousProperties` argument to `provider.update`).
 *   2. For every top-level key whose subtree contains a drifted path,
 *      overwrite it with the corresponding sub-shape from
 *      `desiredProperties` (the state-recorded `observedProperties`).
 *
 * Why "AWS-current base + drifted overlay" instead of "drifted-only
 * partial":
 *
 *   Several providers' `update()` implementations diff
 *   `newProperties[K]` against `previousProperties[K]` and treat
 *   `newVal === undefined` as "remove K from AWS" (e.g.
 *   `SNSTopicProvider` calls `SetTopicAttributes(K, '')`,
 *   `IAMRoleProvider.updateManagedPolicies` detaches every previously
 *   attached policy when the new arg is undefined). Passing a
 *   drifted-only partial would silently clear non-drifted attributes
 *   on those providers. Sending the AWS-current value back as the
 *   "new" value for non-drifted keys keeps `JSON.stringify(newVal) ===
 *   JSON.stringify(oldVal)` so the diff is a no-op — no provider
 *   changes required.
 *
 *   For non-diff providers (e.g. `SQSQueueProvider` blindly pushes
 *   every defined key via `SetQueueAttributes`), the AWS-current
 *   value still gets serialised back to the same string AWS already
 *   has, so the round-trip is a no-op for the AWS resource state.
 *   The one exception is `readCurrentState`'s always-emit
 *   placeholder values — e.g. SQS `RedrivePolicy: {}` — which AWS
 *   rejects as invalid input even though they're round-tripped. That
 *   class of value (Class 2 / structurally-incomplete-when-empty) is
 *   handled by per-provider sanitize at the wire-layer; see the SQS
 *   provider's `serializeRedrivePolicy` helper for the canonical
 *   pattern.
 *
 * The drift comparator never produces array-index segments
 * (`Tags[0].Value`) — array drifts surface as a single entry on the
 * parent path — so `path.split('.', 1)` is always safe to extract the
 * top-level key.
 *
 * `preserveUntemplated` (issue #1626) switches the overlay from WHOLESALE to a
 * deep merge for the drifted subtrees, keeping every path the baseline does
 * not declare. `runRevert` sets it exactly when the resource has no
 * `observedProperties` — see {@link mergeUntemplatedValue} for why that is the
 * only baseline on which it is correct, and why the fix has to live on this
 * side rather than on `previousProperties`.

/**
 * The top-level keys a provider NARROWED on the revert path (issue #1644).
 *
 * `provider.update()` may answer with `effectiveProperties` — the bag it
 * ACTUALLY delivered, which is what AWS now holds. `DeployEngine` records that
 * in place of the desired bag (`propertiesToRecord`), and `--revert` used to
 * throw the return value away: state kept the un-narrowed value, so the very
 * next `cdkd drift` reported the same difference and `--revert` re-issued the
 * same call — the loop `effectiveProperties` exists to break, still live on
 * this one command.
 *
 * Returns a per-key DELTA rather than the whole bag, and that is the load-
 * bearing part. The bag handed to `update()` here is
 * {@link buildRevertNewProperties}'s output — AWS-current values for every
 * non-drifted key merged with the state baseline for the drifted ones — so
 * writing it back wholesale would import AWS-authored values into state for
 * keys nobody reverted, quietly turning `--revert` into `--accept`. Only the
 * keys the PROVIDER changed between what it was handed and what it delivered
 * belong in state.
 *
 * A key present in `sent` but absent from `effective` is a DROP: the provider
 * did not deliver it, so AWS does not hold it, and the baseline must lose it
 * too. That is represented by an explicit `undefined` value, which the caller
 * turns into a `delete` — a plain `{...baseline, ...delta}` spread would leave
 * an `undefined`-valued key in the JSON instead. Presence is decided by
 * OWN-key membership in `effective`, NOT by comparing against `undefined`: a provider that
 * delivers an explicit `undefined` and one that omits the key both mean "AWS
 * does not hold it", while a key whose value genuinely IS `null` on both sides
 * must not read as a drop.
 *
 * The comparison is a key-order-INDEPENDENT deep equality rather than
 * `JSON.stringify`. A provider that rebuilds a nested object while delivering
 * the same members would otherwise register as a change, and the value written
 * back for such a key is the one that was SENT — for a non-drifted key that is
 * the AWS-current value, i.e. the `--accept` behavior this delta exists to
 * prevent.

        //   fallback (`cdkd import`'s warn path writes them there; #2842's
        //   refusal is what routes the revert to that bag). An
        //   `observedProperties` baseline is READBACK-derived — cdkd never
        //   writes an intrinsic object into it — so there a single-key map
        //   literally named `Ref` / `Fn::*` is a real AWS value (a Lambda
        //   env var, a config map), and refusing on it would pin the
        //   resource unrevertable FOREVER, the prescribed remedy re-recording
        //   the same readback on every deploy. Stated residual (PR #2912
        //   round 2): a HAND-EDITED `observedProperties` carrying a genuine
        //   intrinsic ships silently under this gate — outside cdkd's write
        //   contract (no cdkd writer puts an intrinsic object there), and
        //   accepted as the cost of not pinning the readback population.
        // - Scoped to the DRIFTED top-level keys, the only ones the baseline
        //   sources into the send bag.
        // - Reading `desiredProperties` — the BASELINE — rather than the
        //   overlay output (PR #2912 review): `mergeUntemplatedValue`'s
        //   key-merge FUSES a single-key intrinsic with a plain-record live
        //   value (`{Ref:'X'}` against live `{A:1}` becomes

/**
 * Where this file's own human-facing text goes.
 *
 * Issue [#2230](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2230). The plan
 * printers and the confirmation prompt write to `process.stdout` DIRECTLY,
 * so — unlike the `logger.info` lines, which
 * {@link reserveStdoutForPayload} re-routes wholesale — they have to be
 * routed per call site. Under `--json` stdout carries the payload and
 * nothing else, so they move to stderr.
 *
 * MOVED, never dropped. A `--json --accept` run still shows the operator
 * the plan, the prompt and the summary on their terminal; what changes is
 * only which stream a pipe reads. Suppressing them instead would pass a
 * "stdout parses" assertion while losing the information the confirmation
 * is asking about, which is the worse of the two failures.
 *
 * THE TWO MEMBERS BIND AT DIFFERENT TIMES, and the asymmetry is deliberate.
 * `write` is a closure, so `process.stderr.write` is looked up per CALL — a
 * test that swaps the stream method after the sink was built still observes
 * every write. `stream` is the stream OBJECT, captured eagerly, because
 * `readline.createInterface` takes a sink once and holds it for the interface's
 * lifetime; there is no later lookup for a closure to serve. That costs
 * nothing, since swapping a stream's `write` METHOD (what a test does) leaves
 * the captured object identity intact, and replacing `process.stderr` WHOLESALE
 * is not something either the CLI or its tests do. It does mean a test fences
 * `stream` by asserting the IDENTITY handed to `createInterface`, not by
 * capturing bytes.

 *

 * already display the stack name, so a hole beside it invites the operator to
 * fill it from a name the block shows — the misdirection the criterion
 * forbids. The prose keeps its own `for this stack` wording in that case,
 * which names no command to paste.
 *
 * `exact` is not consulted: `isPasteableIdent` is strictly stronger on every

 * admits no `*` or `/`, cannot be empty, and its `displayIdent` compare

 * JSON output shape — stable contract for tooling. Each stack carries

 *
 * Issue [#2108](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2108) added
 * `referencesUnresolved` to every `drifted` and `clean` entry, plus the
 * `notCompared` roll-up, because `clean` was ambiguous in the one direction
 * that matters: a resource whose secret-bearing properties cdkd REFUSED to

 * a resource that was compared and matched. A CI job gating on
 * `drifted.length === 0` therefore read a skipped comparison as a pass. The
 * roll-up is there so such a job needs ONE key rather than a filter over two
 * arrays: `notCompared.length === 0` is the honest "everything was actually
 * checked" predicate.
 *
 * Issue [#2135](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2135) then took the
 * ambiguity out of `clean` itself: an uncompared resource is now reported ONLY
 * under `notCompared`, never in `clean`, because a flag a reader has to
 * remember to consult defaults to the wrong answer when they forget. Every key
 * keeps its name and meaning; what changed is which ARRAY such a resource
 * appears in. `clean[].referencesUnresolved` is therefore `false` for every

 * still finds it, and narrowed to the literal `false` so the invariant is
