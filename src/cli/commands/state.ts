 * default one-reference-per-line listing and the `--long` / `--tree` rows
 * (issue #3069). The unsanitized twin it replaced lost its last caller there.
 *
 * Both halves come from an S3 key segment (or, for a legacy record, a state
 * body), so both are attacker-influenced in exactly the way issue #2170 round
 * 4 found for the lock error sixty lines below this helper's callers: a
 * planted `\n` forged a whole line inside that sentence. A forged line in a
 * PROMPT is strictly worse than one in an error, because the sentence it
 * corrupts is the one the operator answers `y` to.
 *
 * BOTH halves go through `displayIdent`, not the bare `safe()` allowlist below
 * (issue #3164). The allowlist closes line FORGERY and nothing else: it is the
 * identity on printable ASCII, and this function's ` (` / `)` is cdkd's OWN
 * annotation of the line, so a planted 2-segment legacy key
 * `cdkd/ProdStack (us-east-1)/state.json` yields a region-LESS ref whose
 * `stackName` is literally `ProdStack (us-east-1)` and renders BYTE-EQUAL to
 * the genuine `ProdStack` in `us-east-1`. A `while read -r ref` cleanup loop —
 * the consumer the sanitization exists for — cannot tell the two apart, so it
 * acts on the reference the operator believes is real and the planted record
 * survives the sweep. The join in the two prompt callers is a second boundary
 * of the same kind: they `join(', ')`, which a name carrying `, ` forges an
 * extra entry in -- and quoting closes that, since a space is outside
 * `PLAIN_IDENT`.
 *
 * A BARE `,` is NOT closed, and an earlier revision of this comment was wrong
 * to call it harmless: the formatter supplies the space that completes the
 * separator, so `ProdStack,` renders `ProdStack, (us-east-1)` and a two-target
 * list reads as THREE entries. Only `state refresh-observed` prints a count
 * beside its list; `state orphan`'s banner prints none, so there nothing on
 * screen contradicts the forged entry -- the worse of the two. Removing `,`
 * from `PLAIN_IDENT` would close it and was tried; it regresses a legitimate
 * IAM role ARN, whose role-name segment allows `[\w+=,.@-]`. Recorded on
 * go-to-k/cdkd#3179 rather than traded for that.
 *
 * `displayIdent` makes the boundary VISIBLE by JSON-quoting anything that is
 * not a plain identifier, so the row above reads `"ProdStack (us-east-1)"` and
 * no longer collides. It is applied to the REGION half too: a region is an S3
 * key segment (or, for a legacy record, the state body via `readLegacyRegion`),
 * so it is attacker-chosen in exactly the same way, and a planted region alone
 * renders `Decoy (x) (us-east-1)` — the same spoof from the right-hand side.
 *
 * Every legitimate row is byte-identical, because `displayIdent` is the
 * identity on a plain identifier and CloudFormation stack names
 * (`Parent~Child` included) and AWS region codes all are — so no fixture, no
 * script's grep and no round-trip into `cdkd state show` changes. It keeps
 * `safe()`'s `UNRENDERABLE` fallback for a value sanitising leaves empty, since
 * an empty `()` would read as "no region" rather than "a region cdkd will not
 * print".
 *
 * The NAME half passes `STACK_REF_MAX_CODE_POINTS` rather than taking
 * `displayIdent`'s 255 default, and that is load-bearing for the paragraph
 * above rather than a tuning knob: a cdkd state-record name is not a
 * CloudFormation stack name, because `deriveChildStackName` appends
 * `~<logicalId>` per nesting level, so a legitimate deep nested-stack child
 * exceeds 255 and would be rendered CUT — a byte change on a legitimate row, in
 * the middle of a line `while read -r ref` consumes. The REGION half keeps the
 * default; an AWS region code is at most 25 characters.
 *
 * The consequence is taken at ALL SIX callers, the confirmation prompt
 * included, rather than at the listing alone: guarding one site and leaving
 * five is the per-site spelling `safe()`'s own comment below records having
 * failed twice. In the prompt a quoted spoof is the most valuable of the six —
 * that sentence is the one an operator answers `y` to.
 *
 * What the quoting is NOT: shell-safe. A JSON string literal is visually
 * indistinguishable from a shell DOUBLE-quoted argument, in which `$(...)`,
 * backticks and `!` still expand — so `"Prod$(touch /tmp/pwn)" (us-east-1)`
 * must not be pasted into a command line, and this rendering makes no claim
 * that it may be. The repo's answer for a value that has to survive a command
 * line is elsewhere and is SUPPRESSION, not quoting: `buildForceUnlockCommand`
 * declines to print a command at all unless sanitisation was the identity, and
 * `rollback-executor.ts`'s `PASTEABLE_LOGICAL_ID` records why identity alone is
 * still not enough (`~user` and `=x` expand). What this function provides is a
 * visible BOUNDARY for a value a human is reading, which is a different job.

 * interpolating a `listStacks()` region raw (go-to-k/cdkd#3027). That is the
 * same over-claiming shape `lock-manager.ts`'s twin helper records having got
 * wrong three times.
 *
 * It exists as one function rather than the expression repeated per site
 * because the failure this closes WAS the repeated form: issue #2772 guarded
 * the rendered rows and left the refusals, and the first cut of #3003 guarded
 * three refusals and left four more in these same two commands. A value
 * reaching a message is the population, not a list of call sites.
 *
 * `asciiOnly` because the population has a known charset — CloudFormation
 * constrains a stack name and AWS constrains a region, so the allowlist is a
 * no-op on every legitimate input while an S3 key admits any UTF-8. Free-form
 * text (a parser's own message, an AWS error) takes the denylist class
 * instead; `display-safe.ts`'s header draws that line.
 *
 * It is the WEAKER of this file's two spellings and stays so deliberately.
 * `formatStackRefSafe` above uses `displayIdent` instead, because it renders
 * cdkd's own ` (region)` annotation right beside the value and the allowlist
 * cannot stop a value from carrying that annotation itself (issue #3164).
 * Widening this helper is tracked as go-to-k/cdkd#3179 rather than done here,
 * for reasons that are per-SITE rather than uniform, so read that issue's
 * table rather than generalising from this paragraph: most of these sites are
 * REFUSALS, where the surrounding `'...'` is at least SOME boundary -- but not
 * all of them are, and `  Region: ${safe(...)}` in the `--long` view below has
 * no surrounding anything -- while `Run 'cdkd deploy <stack>'` sites are
 * COMMAND HINTS, where quoting is not this repo's answer at all:
 * `buildForceUnlockCommand` SUPPRESSES the whole command instead.
 *
 * `grep safe(` does NOT enumerate the class, in BOTH directions. Some sites
 * spell `displaySafe(..., { asciiOnly: true })` inline rather than calling this
 * helper (`warnOnLiveForeignLock` renders its own `stack (region)` that way,
 * inside the same `state orphan` output); others sanitise NOTHING
 * (`stateRefreshObservedCommand` interpolates raw `listStacks` values into its
 * refusals, including a third `cdkd deploy` hint, and `stateDestroyCommand`
 * writes raw names into its `--all` confirmation list); and `describeStateKey`
 * (`state-file-keys.ts`) renders the same shape from raw key segments.
 * go-to-k/cdkd#3179 enumerates them all; a grep of this helper does not.

 * 5,000,002 lines; the same shape in `skippedOutputs` costs ~2436 ms and
 * ~2148 MB. `--show-nested` pays that per node.
 *
 * AT THE RENDER ENTRY, not at the four loops, which is the rule
 * `src/state/malformed-resources-bag.ts`'s header records and the measurement
 * behind it. Here the reason the entry wins is narrower but the same in kind:
 * the per-resource containers are reached from inside the resource loop, so a

 * the `?? {}` already sitting at each of them is exactly the spelling that

 * {@link hasReadableResources} makes.** `undefined` and `null` both mean "no
 * such container" for all four, and the `?? {}` at each walk has always
 * rendered the nullish case as empty, so none of them can fabricate a row.
 * An unreadable `resources` bag is judged the other way because
 * `Object.entries(null)` THROWS and takes the whole render with it.
 *
 * The stronger half of the reason covers TWO of the four, not all of them, and
 * saying so is the point: `skippedOutputs?` and `attributes?` are OPTIONAL in
 * `src/types/state.ts`, so cdkd itself writes records without them and warning
 * would be a false positive on healthy state. `outputs` and `properties` are
 * REQUIRED there, so a nullish one IS a malformed record and this exemption
 * rests on the weaker reason alone — it cannot invent a row, and it renders
 * identically to the empty bag the reader would otherwise see. Warning on a
 * nullish REQUIRED container would be defensible; it is not done because the
 * harm this guard exists for is fabrication (review of go-to-k/cdkd#3190).
 *
 * Callers must have repaired the `resources` bag first; both do — one line up
 * in `repairRecordForTextRender`, and ~30 lines up in `stateResourcesCommand`,
 * where the mode gate sits between them.
 * The bag test below is that ORDER made local rather than a fallback: an
 * unreadable bag is emptied by the repair, so the record renders zero resources
 * and owns no per-resource container to repair. It reads
 * {@link isReadableBag} rather than {@link hasReadableResources} on purpose —
 * the latter is the probe `tests/unit/cli/state-record-shape.test.ts` counts to
 * measure the nested walk, and a second caller here would silently inflate it.

 * - Refuses to remove a locked region's state unless `--force` is set, since

 * - Confirmation prompt defaults to `(y/N)`, requiring an explicit `y` —
 *   this is more cautious than `cdkd destroy` because the operation orphans

/**
 * `cdkd state destroy <stacks...>` command implementation
 *
 * Destroys a stack's AWS resources AND removes its state record, **without**
 * requiring the CDK app (no synth). The intended audience is anyone who
 * needs to clean up a stack from a working directory that doesn't have the
 * CDK source — a teammate on a different machine, a CI cleanup job after the
 * source repo is gone, etc.
 *
 * Naming distinction:
 * - `cdkd destroy` — synth-driven, requires the CDK app, deletes resources +
 *   state.
 * - `cdkd state destroy` — state-driven, no synth needed, deletes resources +
 *   state.
 * - `cdkd orphan` — synth-driven, requires the CDK app, deletes ONLY the
 *   state record. AWS resources are left intact.
 * - `cdkd state orphan` — state-driven, no synth needed, deletes ONLY the
 *   state record. AWS resources are left intact.
 *
 * Region scoping: when a stack name has multiple state records spread across
 * regions (PR 1 territory), `--stack-region` selects one — it picks WHICH
 * record is loaded, because the region is part of the S3 key.
 *
 * What it does with a record whose BODY names a different region than that key
 * is two things, neither of which this comment described until issue
 * [#3328](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/3328) — it claimed a refusal
 * on `state.region` that had never existed anywhere in the command, while the
 * measured behaviour was the opposite: a planted record at
 * `.../us-east-1/state.json` carrying `"region": "eu-west-1"` locked, saved
 * and deleted against `eu-west-1` and reported `✓ State deleted` while the
 * us-east-1 key survived.
 *
 * 1. `S3StateBackend.getState` normalizes the loaded record's `region` to the
 *    KEY's and WARNS, so this command — which hands `stateResult.state`
 *    straight to `runDestroyForStack` — acts on the region it was pointed at.
 *    The read itself refuses NOTHING; `adoptKeyRegion` carries why, and it is
 *    what keeps `state show` / `state list` / `state orphan` working on such a
 *    record.
 * 2. The DESTROY refuses it when the record still lists resources
 *    (`refuseDivergentRecordRegionForDestroy`, reached through
 *    `runDestroyForStack`), because which region those resources are in is
 *    exactly what the divergence makes undecidable. A resource-less record is
 *    not refused, so cleaning one up still works.

/**
 * `cdkd state refresh-observed <stack>` command implementation.
 *
 * Walks every resource in the given stack(s) and refreshes its
 * `observedProperties` field by calling the matching provider's
 * `readCurrentState`. The result is the same baseline that a fresh
 * `cdkd deploy` would produce — but without re-deploying anything.
 *
 * Why this exists: state schema `version: 3` (`observedProperties`)
 * shipped after many users had already deployed stacks under v2.
 * `cdkd deploy` only populates `observedProperties` on resources that
 * actually go through CREATE / UPDATE — `NO_CHANGE`-skipped resources
 * stay with `observedProperties: undefined` indefinitely after the
 * upgrade, and `cdkd drift` falls back to `properties` baseline for
 * those (= the pre-v3 behavior, missing console-side changes to keys
 * the user did not template). This command lets users opt into the
 * richer drift baseline for the whole stack in one shot.
 *
 * Behavior:
 *  - Acquires a per-stack lock (scope: `state-refresh-observed`).
 *  - Calls `provider.readCurrentState` in parallel (Promise.all) for the
 *    resources that REACH it. FOUR paths do not, and review had to correct
 *    this sentence twice — first from "every resource", then from three arms
 *    to four. A resource whose record carries `observedBaselineRefused` (v10)
 *    is SKIPPED before the provider is consulted and warned about separately,
 *    since refreshing it could persist a resolved secret in plaintext. The
 *    other three all count as `unsupported`: a type
 *    `ProviderRegistry.shouldSkipResource` declines (returning before the
 *    lookup), a type with no registered provider, and a provider that does not
 *    implement `readCurrentState`. A per-resource failure is
 *    COUNTED and logged at
 *    `warn` naming the resource and the error, the rest of the stack is
 *    still refreshed and saved, and the affected resource keeps whatever
 *    `observedProperties` it already had (or none). So drift keeps
 *    comparing against that RETAINED baseline where one exists, and falls
 *    back to `properties` only where there is none — review caught the
 *    unqualified claim, which said it always falls back. The run
 *    then ends in `PartialFailureError` (exit 2) naming the count, which
 *    is what distinguishes it from a crash. (This block travelled here
 *    from `src/utils/pasteable-command.ts`, where it documented nothing;
 *    review measured that it also described the old, swallow-and-debug
 *    behaviour rather than the current one.)
 *  - Writes state with optimistic locking (`expectedEtag`).
 *  - Prints a per-stack summary: `N refreshed, M unsupported, K failed`.
 *
 * Flag set mirrors `state destroy`:
 *  - `--all` — refresh every stack in the state bucket.
 *  - `--stack-region <region>` — disambiguate when the same stackName
 *    has state in multiple regions.
 *  - `--dry-run` — print the planned refresh count per stack and exit
 *    without acquiring a lock or writing state.
 *  - `-y` / `--yes` — skip the confirmation prompt.
 *  - Standard state options + `--profile` / `--role-arn` / `--verbose`.

          // `properties` (its warn path says so), and walking a STRING readback
          // against it used to persist the decrypted value here. The remedy is

          // element is reached; and, for a list with no identity key, the
          // corroborated positional walk `unkeyedArrayPairsByAnchors` licenses
          // (issue #2012). "Descent stays off" is about pairing by INDEX ALONE,

          // path pass (`redactByPath`'s equal-length array arm, plus the
          // `positionalIsExact` fallback for an unpaired keyed element), AND —
          // because `!descendArrays` is one of the three conjuncts in
          // `isReadbackProjectedFromState` — it switches the CORROBORATED pass
