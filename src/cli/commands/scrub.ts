/**
 * `cdkd scrub` — rewrite persisted state so any resolved secret dynamic
 * reference is stored as its UNRESOLVED expression rather than the plaintext
 * value (GHSA fix). "Secret" here is whatever the RESOLVER classifies as one,
 * which is the single source of truth this command shares with the deploy
 * path: every `{{resolve:secretsmanager:...}}`, plus a `{{resolve:ssm:...}}`
 * naming a `SecureString` parameter (issue #1901). scrub therefore gains a new
 * secret class automatically, with no second list to keep in sync.
 *
 * A normal `cdkd deploy` already scrubs state as a side effect (the deploy
 * engine redacts every persisted bag), so this command is for cleaning up
 * existing state WITHOUT a redeploy — e.g. after upgrading cdkd on a stack you
 * do not want to re-provision right now.
 *
 * It needs the CDK app (`--app`) because a state file records the RESOLVED
 * plaintext with no marker of which values are secrets: only the template
 * carries the `{{resolve:...}}` expressions. So scrub synthesizes the template,
 * re-resolves each resource's properties to learn the resolved secret VALUES
 * (recorded, never printed or re-persisted), and replaces those values in the
 * state record's `properties` / `attributes` / `observedProperties` with the
 * expression. No AWS resource is created, updated, or deleted; only state.json
 * is rewritten. This is why it is a top-level command and not `cdkd state
 * scrub` — the `cdkd state ...` family operates on the state bucket alone and
 * deliberately needs no CDK code.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: scrubbing does not un-expose an already-leaked secret. A value
 * that was stored in plaintext should be treated as compromised and ROTATED at
 * its source — in Secrets Manager, or by re-putting the `SecureString` SSM
 * parameter; scrub only stops it from being re-read out of state going
 * forward.
 *
 * OUTPUTS: `state.outputs` is scrubbed alongside the resource records, and its
 * repair scope is WIDER than today's declared outputs (issue #2005). A stored
 * output key the template can still name is redacted BY POSITION against that
 * template; a key it cannot name is repaired when its stored value MATCHES a
 * secret plaintext recorded anywhere this run, including one only a RESOURCE
 * still references. The motivating member of that population is an output
 * DELETED in an ordinary refactor, but it is not the only one — a key this run
 * cannot COMPUTE is in it too, and a parameterized `Export.Name` (scrub has
 * only template defaults) leaves the deploy's real alias key unaccounted on
 * EVERY run. When nothing recorded the plaintext the value is left exactly as
 * it is: a scrub that cannot identify the needle must not guess, because
 * `state.outputs` is re-applied VERBATIM to consumer stacks — by the exports
 * index (`src/state/export-index-store.ts`) and by `Fn::ImportValue` /
 * `Fn::GetStackOutput` (`src/deployment/intrinsic-function-resolver.ts`) — so a
 * fabricated redaction ships a literal `{{resolve:...}}` token into a
 * consumer's own AWS call. (`cdkd drift` is NOT one of those readers: it reads
 * `state.resources`, never `state.outputs`.) See `redactUnaccountedOutputs`.
 *
 * A FOURTH re-apply reader exists and is recorded here so the next audit does
 * not have to re-derive it: `NestedStackProvider.buildOutputsAttributes`
 * projects a CHILD record's `state.outputs` into the PARENT's
 * `Fn::GetAtt Outputs.X` attributes, i.e. into a parent resource property. It
 * is OUT of this command's reach, not exempt from the hazard — `scrubCommand`
 * targets synth STACK ARTIFACTS, and a nested child is a `nestedTemplates`
 * entry on its parent's `StackInfo` rather than an `aws:cloudformation:stack`
 * artifact of its own (`src/synthesis/assembly-reader.ts`), so the
 * `{parent}~{Child}` record this walk reads is never a stack scrub writes. If
 * scrub ever gains nested-child targets, this reader joins the list above and
 * the fabrication bound has to be re-argued for it.
 *
 * ORDERING: scrub matches the CURRENT resolved secret value against what state
 * holds, so run it BEFORE rotating. Once the secret is rotated, the value in
 * state no longer matches the current one and scrub cannot find it (it reports
 * "nothing to scrub"). A rotated-away stale value in state is invalidated by
 * the rotation, but to remove it, redeploy the stack (which rewrites the record
 * with the expression).

/**
 * Every secret plaintext this run recorded, from ANY position in the template
 * (issue #2005) — the outputs' own map plus every resource's, filtered to the
 * values long enough to be a safe needle.
 *
 * Used ONLY by {@link redactUnaccountedOutputs}, which is why the union is built
 * here rather than kept as the pass's input everywhere: `outputSecrets` and
 * `perResourceSecrets` are deliberately SEPARATE bags so one resource's secret
 * value cannot rewrite another resource's coinciding literal (the collision the
 * deploy engine's `perResourceSecrets` doc describes), and widening the bag the
 * RESOURCE walk uses would re-open exactly that.
 *
 * On a value collision the outputs' expression wins: it is written last, and an
 * output KEY is the closest kin of the bag this map is scanned against. Both
 * expressions resolve to the same plaintext by construction (that is what makes
 * them collide), so the choice costs precision, not correctness — the residual
 * documented for the ambiguous-key fallback one screen up. A resource-vs-
 * resource collision is NOT ordered by anything: `perResourceSecrets` is
 * iterated in map order and the LAST logical id wins, so between two resources
 * resolving one plaintext the surviving expression is whichever the walk
 * reached last. Same trade as above (both resolve to the same value), stated
 * because only the outputs-vs-resource half used to be.
 *
 * **The needle floor is the security half, and it looks like it contradicts
 * repo policy without doing so.** `redactSecretsForState`'s no-source arm
 * matches a WHOLE VALUE at ANY length; only its substring arm honors
 * {@link MIN_NEEDLE_LENGTH}. That is sound for a POSITION-SCOPED bag, where the
 * candidate leaf is already known to belong to the reference. This union has no
 * position source at all, so an unfiltered 1-3 character plaintext recorded by
 * ANY resource would whole-value-match an unrelated stored output and rewrite
 * it onto that resource's expression. Issues #2012 / #2036 do say that with no
 * evidence OVER-redaction is the right failure, because it is "visible,
 * recoverable, and not a disclosure" — but that asymmetry is about a DRIFT
 * BASELINE, and it does not transfer here: `state.outputs` is re-applied
 * VERBATIM to consumer stacks by the exports index
 * (`src/state/export-index-store.ts`) and by `Fn::ImportValue` /
 * `Fn::GetStackOutput` (`src/deployment/intrinsic-function-resolver.ts`), so a
 * false redaction ships a literal `{{resolve:...}}` token into a consumer's own
 * AWS call — the #1934 class, a BREAK rather than a recoverable mismatch. (Two
 * readers, not the whole list: the module doc records a third that is out of
 * this command's reach, with the derivation.)
 *
 * The floor is applied to the WHOLE union, `outputSecrets` included, and that
 * narrows NOTHING that worked before. The positioning pass still runs FIRST
 * over the same bag with the UNFILTERED `outputSecrets`, whole-value-matching
 * at any length, and {@link redactUnaccountedOutputs} scans the STORED value —
 * so a sub-floor output secret it cannot see compares equal, falls through, and
 * the positioned leaf survives into `repaired ?? positioned`. Pinned by the
 * suite's "still repairs a SCALAR unaccounted key holding a sub-floor OUTPUT
 * secret" case (`ab1` -> its expression — the exact shape the false note
 * described) and by its non-scalar sibling "keeps the POSITIONED value". The
 * floor's effect is therefore confined to CROSS-RESOURCE needles: a sub-floor
 * plaintext recorded only by a RESOURCE never becomes a needle for the outputs
 * bag. Stated because an earlier revision claimed a narrowing here, and a false
 * "we gave this up" note is how a capability gets removed for real later.
 *
 * **What the floor does NOT bound, stated plainly because it is the residual a
 * reader will otherwise assume away.** `redactSecretsForState`'s SUBSTRING arm
 * runs over this union too, so a recorded plaintext of {@link
 * MIN_NEEDLE_LENGTH} characters or more occurring ANYWHERE inside an unrelated
 * unaccounted output WILL be rewritten. `secretValueFromJson('username')`
 * resolving `admin` turns a stored `https://admin.example.com` into
 * `https://{{resolve:secretsmanager:...}}.example.com`, which the exports index
 * republishes and a consumer's `Fn::ImportValue` then ships to AWS as a literal
 * token — the #1934 BREAK class, from a value that was never a secret.
 *
 * That arm is kept, and raising the floor for this union alone was considered
 * and REJECTED, on three grounds:
 *
 * - **Substring matching is what makes the repair work at all.** A connection
 *   string embedding a password is #2005's own target shape and this suite's
 *   own `DbUrl` case; gutting the arm would leave the motivating population
 *   unrepairable, which is the disclosure the command exists to remove.
 * - **Length is a weak proxy for the hazard, in both directions.** The values
 *   that collide with unrelated text are common tokens — `admin`, `prod`,
 *   `root` — and raising the bar to 8 admits `password`, `postgres`,
 *   `localhost`, which are longer AND likelier to occur inside a stored URL. A
 *   higher floor would refuse genuine short secrets while still admitting the
 *   colliding ones.
 * - **4 is the repo's ONE answer, and a second number would have no
 *   derivation.** `secret-redaction.ts`'s own needles, `stateKeySecretExposure`
 *   (#1919) and `drift.ts`'s `carriesRecordedSecret` all use it. A union-only 8
 *   would be the only such constant in the tree justified by taste, and a later
 *   reader could not tell which is authoritative.
 *
 * The trade is right for a GHSA repair command because the two failure
 * directions differ on REVERSIBILITY, not on likelihood. A fabricated rewrite
 * is loud and remediable: the consumer's next deploy fails on an unresolvable
 * token, and the operator fixes the template or edits the key out of state. An
 * unrepaired plaintext is silent and permanent — the key is one today's
 * template does not declare, so no redeploy ever rewrites it, and no other
 * command can. Refusing the substring arm here would trade the irreversible
 * failure for the reversible one in the wrong direction.

/**
 * Repair a stored output key today's template cannot ACCOUNT for (issue
 * [#2005](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2005)) — the population `cdkd
 * scrub` is documented as the remedy for and could not actually remedy.
 *
 * `outputSecrets` is built from today's DECLARED outputs, and the outputs
 * redaction above is gated on it being non-empty. An output DELETED from the
 * template contributes nothing to that set, so a record whose only
 * secret-bearing output has since been removed was reported CLEAN by the
 * command whose job is to clean it, while the plaintext stayed in
 * `state.outputs` until an unrelated deploy happened to rewrite the bag. That
 * is precisely the record `cdkd diff` withholds from display
 * ([#1948](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1948)): correctly hidden, and
 * until now not repairable.
 *
 * TWO scope decisions, and both are load-bearing.
 *
 * 1. **WHICH keys.** Only keys today's template cannot name — not in
 *    `accountedKeys` (every declared output name plus every `Export.Name` this
 *    run could compute). A key the template DOES name is left exactly as the
 *    pass above leaves it, deliberately, because that pass POSITIONS it against
 *    the template and this one cannot: scanning an accounted key against the
 *    union bag would let one resource's secret plaintext rewrite a declared
 *    output's coinciding literal onto that resource's expression — a value
 *    state was never meant to hold, in the command that exists to make state
 *    trustworthy. The accepted residual, stated because narrowing is what buys
 *    the safety: a DECLARED output whose template value no longer resolves a
 *    secret, but whose STORED value is still the stale plaintext of one a
 *    resource carries, is not repaired here either. A redeploy rewrites it.
 *
 * 2. **WHAT may be rewritten.** Only a value that genuinely MATCHES a recorded
 *    plaintext — `redactSecretsForState`'s value scan with no source, i.e. a
 *    whole-value match and an embedded one, both bounded at
 *    {@link MIN_NEEDLE_LENGTH} by {@link allRecordedSecrets}. A scrub that
 *    cannot identify the needle must not guess: `state.outputs` is re-applied
 *    VERBATIM to consumer stacks by the exports index and by `Fn::ImportValue`
 *    / `Fn::GetStackOutput` (and by one more reader out of this command's
 *    reach — see the module doc), so a fabricated redaction ships a literal
 *    `{{resolve:...}}` token into a consumer's AWS call. No key is invented and
 *    no key is removed for the same reason. When nothing this run recorded the
 *    plaintext (the secret was deleted, rotated away, or the reference is gone
 *    from the template too) the value is LEFT ALONE — but note that behavior
 *    does NOT live in this function's `secrets.size === 0` guard, which is one
 *    of three redundant reasons and fences none of them; see the guard's own
 *    comment for what actually reaches it.
 *
 * **The scanned VALUE is the STORED one, never the positioned pass's output**
 * (blocker found in review). Scanning an already-positioned leaf means scanning
 * an expression the first pass just INSERTED, and `redactSecretsForState`'s
 * token guard protects only a WHOLE-VALUE token — so a MIXED leaf
 * (`postgres://admin:{{resolve:secretsmanager:prod/db:...}}@app-db`, the
 * `Fn::Join` shape CDK emits) gets re-scanned and any union needle occurring
 * INSIDE the inserted reference is spliced into it, corrupting the expression
 * into one no service can resolve (the corruption `secret-redaction.ts`'s own
 * token guard documents). A single union scan of the STORED value subsumes the
 * first pass for these keys rather than composing with it: the union is a
 * superset of `outputSecrets` with the outputs' expression winning a collision,
 * and an unaccounted key by construction has no position source in
 * `outputsTemplateSource` (every key that bag carries — a declared output name
 * or a literal `Export.Name` — is in `accountedKeys`), so the first pass could
 * only ever have value-scanned it too.
 *
 * **The repaired population is WIDER than "an output you deleted."** Any stored
 * key today's template cannot COMPUTE is in it, and a parameterized
 * `Export.Name` is the standing example: `scrub` has only template defaults, so
 * a name resolving to the literal `prefix-${Foo}` leaves the REAL alias key the
 * deploy wrote unaccounted on EVERY run, and that key gets cross-resource value
 * matching for as long as the parameter stays unresolvable here. That is the
 * accepted cost of not being able to reproduce the key — the alternative is
 * leaving a permanently unrepairable key — but it is a standing exposure to the
 * fabrication risk above rather than a one-off after a refactor.
 *
 * Returns the input by IDENTITY when nothing changed. That is worth doing on
 * its own terms (no churn, no needless clone), but it is NOT what keeps the
 * caller honest: the caller compares with `JSON.stringify` unconditionally, so
 * an identity return cannot make it cheaper and a fresh-but-equal object could
 * not make it report a repair it did not perform.

 * The first two assembled rows are caught by the COUNT. The fourth is not, and

 * `}}` that follows closes the match one brace short, so the scan returns
 * `"{{resolve:secretsmanager:x:SecretString:${Field}"` + `}` — a token, of the
 * right class, exactly one per opening. It is caught instead by the second
 * test: a WHOLE token that still contains `${` has not been assembled yet.
 * Neither a Secrets Manager secret name nor an SSM parameter name may contain
 * `$` or `{`, so the only false positive that test can produce is a JSON key
 * literally spelled `${...}` in a leaf that is NOT under an `Fn::Sub` — and a
 * false positive here now costs a DEFERRAL rather than a refusal, so it is
 * cheaper than it was when this predicate raised
 * `SCRUB_SECRET_REFERENCE_UNCLASSIFIABLE`.
 *
 * WHAT A `true` MEANS FOR THE CALLER, and it changed with issue
 * [#2157](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2157): the leaf is handed on
 * BY IDENTITY, so the PRIMARY resolver classifies the reference once
 * `resolveSub` / `resolveJoin` have assembled it. Before issue
 * [#2134](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2134) that was issue #2109
 * verbatim — the resolver had no region question at all, so an identity return
 * meant a foreign secret fetched against the stack's own endpoint, and this
 * predicate therefore had to REFUSE (gated on a foreign producer region being
 * on record, to keep it from refusing the world). #2134 put the classification
 * in `resolveDynamicReferences`, which sees the COMPLETE expression, so the
 * safety property the refusal bought — a reference whose region cannot be
 * established is never resolved in the stack's own region — is now bought
 * downstream over strictly more information.
 *
 * The trailing-placeholder row reached the resolver a different way before that
 * second test existed: the truncated token WAS classified here, and only
 * downstream luck kept it safe (the name form classifies `ambiguous`, the ARN
 * form fails into `SCRUB_CROSS_REGION_SECRET_UNRESOLVED` because the id it
 * looks up still has a literal `${Field}` in it). Post-#2157 it is deferred
 * like the other three, and the resolver answers it on the assembled
 * expression instead of on a token one brace short. Every row is pinned by the
 * suite rather than assumed.
 *
 * Residual, unchanged and stated rather than hidden: an `Fn::Join` that splits
 * BEFORE the service name opens no counted reference at all (see
 * {@link SECRET_REFERENCE_OPENINGS}), so this predicate returns `false` for it
 * and the leaf is returned by identity anyway — the same destination, reached
 * without being noticed.

  //    today's scan rather than of this function, and `!==` is the spelling that
  //    still refuses if a future scanner emits a token this count did not see.
  // 2. PLACEHOLDER. A whole token that still contains `${` is a TRAILING
  //    `Fn::Sub` placeholder, which the count provably cannot see.
  //
  // NOT A REFUSAL ANY MORE — it DEFERS (issue
  // [#2157](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2157)). Until issue
  // [#2134](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2134) this same condition
  // threw `SCRUB_SECRET_REFERENCE_UNCLASSIFIABLE` whenever a foreign producer
  // region was also on record, because there was then genuinely nowhere else
  // the question could be asked: the reference did not exist as a complete
  // expression anywhere, so nothing downstream could classify it either.
  // #2134 moved the classification INTO `resolveDynamicReferences`, which runs
  // on the ASSEMBLED expression (`resolveSub` / `resolveJoin` re-enter it with
  // their result), and `scrubStack` supplies that resolver the same
  // `producerRegions` evidence this pre-pass holds. So the leaf is now handed
  // on BY IDENTITY and answered where the whole expression exists — routed to
  // the region its ARN names, or refused per reference by the resolver's own
  // `DYNAMIC_REFERENCE_REGION_AMBIGUOUS`.
  //
  // WHAT IS PRESERVED, AND WHAT IS NOT. The property the refusal bought against
  // a WRONG-REGION read is preserved, and over strictly MORE information: the
  // resolver classifies the ASSEMBLED expression rather than the raw leaf, and
  // `classifyReplaySecretRegion` verdicts an ARN-form token `named-region`
  // whatever evidence it holds, so a deferred reference is never resolved in the
  // stack's own region.
  //
  // What is NOT preserved is LOUDNESS ON A FAILED LOOKUP, and claiming otherwise
  // was this change's first draft (three independent reviews found it). The
  // refusal fired BEFORE any lookup; deferring moves the lookup inside
  // `resolver.resolve`, whose errors land in `scrubStack`'s best-effort catch --
  // so a producer region answering AccessDenied, or a secret that no longer
  // exists, became a `logger.debug` under a `No plaintext secrets found`
  // summary, which is the outcome this command exists to prevent. It is closed
  // on the CALLER's side rather than here: the deferral is RECORDED (see
  // {@link CrossRegionSecretContext.deferredAssembled}) and a failure over a
  // recorded leaf becomes a warned FINDING that stops the stack being reported
  // clean. A finding and not a refusal, because the error arrives from a
  // whole-bag resolution and cannot be attributed to this leaf.
  //
  // Deferring is unconditional on evidence, unlike the refusal it replaces.
  // The refusal was gated on `foreignProducerRegions.length > 0` to keep it
  // from refusing the world; deferral needs no such gate, because the reason
  // to defer is that THIS pass cannot classify an unassembled leaf, which is

 *
 * WHY SCRUB NEEDS THIS AT ALL. `scrubStack` learns which plaintexts to look for
 * by RE-RESOLVING the template through one resolver built from the stack's own
 * region, and `resolveSecretsManagerReference` builds its client from that
 * region and passes the SECRET_ID through as an opaque string — the AWS SDK's
 * endpoint ruleset has no ARN-derived endpoint rule, so a reference naming
 * another region's ARN is sent to this stack's regional endpoint. Both halves
 * of that go wrong at once, and the second is the one that is easy to miss: the
 * plaintext scrub exists to remove is never found (the needle is the wrong
 * region's value), so the command reports the stack CLEAN over state that still
 * holds the secret; and the foreign value is a real string, so scanning for it
 * can rewrite an unrelated stored literal that happens to coincide.
 *
 * The split is `classifyReplaySecretRegion`'s, imported from
 * `rollback-executor.ts` rather than re-spelled — one answer to "which region
 * must answer for this expression", shared by the rollback replay (#2057) and
 * by scrub. Its known OVER-refusal is inherited with it: a name-form reference
 * in a stack with ANY foreign producer region on record is refused even when it
 * is the stack's own purely-local secret, because the evidence
 * (`state.imports` / `state.outputReads`) is per-STACK and not per-reference.
 * That is the fail-closed side of a trade whose other side is a silently
 * unscrubbed state file.
 *
 * Returns the bag BY IDENTITY when nothing was foreign, which is every bag on
 * every existing code path. The caller keeps the ORIGINAL bag as its position
 * source either way — a substituted copy must never reach
 * `redactSecretsForState`, whose whole job is to read UNRESOLVED expressions

 * [#2146](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2146) review).
 *
 * SEPARATE FROM THE ERROR BUILDER so both can be tested over verdict shapes the
 * walk does not produce today. The one below — `chained` with an EMPTY `via` —
 * is exactly such a shape: unreachable, because `chained` only ever returns
 * from a non-root frame whose `via` therefore has at least one entry, and yet
 * the arm that used to catch it was the WIDENED wording, which asserts "this run
 * could not match '<key>' to a declared output" — false of every `chained`
 * verdict, since a chained one matched the key and left through its value.
 *
 * WHICH SIGNAL KEYS WHICH ARM, since this file has now been round-tripped on it
 * once. The CLAIM keys on `kind`: only `widened` may say "could not say which",
 * and no amount of chain changes that. WHAT the claim names keys on the chain:
 * a `widened` verdict CAN have crossed a re-export, and saying "publishes at
 * least one output from a `{{resolve:...}}` expression" when the walk has just
 * established that none of its outputs does is the same over-claim in the other
 * direction.
 *
 * `via` IS DE-DUPLICATED, and may name the producer itself (issue #2146 review).
 * A chain that returns to the direct producer under a DIFFERENT output key —
 * `A -> B -> A`, or a self-import `A -> A` — is a real walk result, since the
 * visited set is keyed by `(stack, key)` rather than by stack. Left as-is it
 * rendered "producer 'A' ... RE-EXPORTING a value that 'A' declares ... (through
 * 'A')" and a remedy running `cdkd scrub A` two or three times, which reads as a
 * bug in the tool rather than as advice. The claim de-duplicates
 * ORDER-PRESERVINGLY keeping the FIRST occurrence (so the stack that declares
 * the expression stays last, where `chainRoot` reads it), and the remedy keeps
 * the LAST (so the DIRECT producer — the one actually holding the plaintext —
 * stays at the end of the order, where the user must scrub it).
 *
 * Naming the producer inside its own chain is left standing rather than
 * filtered: for `A -> B -> A` it is A that declares the expression, under an
 * output the consumer's key did not match, so dropping it would move the claim
 * onto B, which declares nothing.

 * SECRET" and "the producer stored an ordinary non-secret value" are
 * indistinguishable — a bucket name and a leaked password are both bare
 * strings — so a refusal keyed on the producer's STORED value alone would fire
 * on every multi-stack app that imports anything at all. An export whose
 * declared `Value` contains no `{{resolve:` anywhere cannot be secret-bearing,
 * so its plaintext is nothing to redact.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT answer is whether the producer's own STATE has
 * been scrubbed down to that expression yet, which is the other half and the
 * one the three earlier cuts of this file each got wrong. See the discriminator
 * in {@link makeCrossStackPrePass}.
 *
 * `key` is the state.outputs KEY the read matched, which the deploy engine
 * writes under BOTH the output name and the literal `Export.Name` — hence both
 * are matched. When no output matches (an INTRINSIC `Export.Name`, which scrub
 * cannot reproduce from here) the test widens to every output of the producer,
 * which over-approximates in the SAFE direction: it can refuse a stack that
 * imports a non-secret export from a producer that has some other secret
 * output, and it never lets a secret-bearing one through. The widening is
 * REPORTED rather than folded into a boolean, because the refusal message
 * asserts what the producer declares and only the `declared` verdict has
 * checked that for THIS key.
 *
 * RE-EXPORT CHAINS ARE FOLLOWED (issue
 * [#2146](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2146)). A MIDDLE stack whose
 * output is `{"Fn::ImportValue": "<upstream export>"}` declares no literal
 * `{{resolve:` of its own, so the single-template test returned `no` for it and
 * the consumer at the END of the chain was reported CLEAN over its surviving
 * plaintext — the #2133 silent success, reached through a re-export instead of
 * a direct import. (`cdkd scrub --all` masks it: `orderScrubTargets` scrubs
 * producers first, so the middle stack stores the expression by the time the
 * consumer is reached. `cdkd scrub <one stack>` does not.) This walk therefore
 * follows a matched output's `Fn::ImportValue` (through the export-name index)
 * and its `Fn::GetStackOutput` (through the literal `StackName` / `OutputName`)
 * into the next producer's template, and keeps going until it finds an
 * expression or runs out of reachable outputs.
 *
 * TERMINATION IS A VISITED SET over `(stack, key)` pairs, NOT a hop cap. Each
 * pair expands deterministically, so a second visit can never yield evidence
 * the first did not, and the pair space is finite (stacks x outputs) — so the
 * walk halts on a CYCLE (two stacks re-exporting each other; no deploy can
 * produce one, a template can express one) while losing no reach. A depth cap
 * was rejected because it is lossy in the one direction that matters: a chain
 * longer than the cap would return `no`, which is exactly the silent success
 * this walk exists to kill.
 *
 * WIDENING IS ROOT-ONLY, and that means WHERE THE FALLBACK FIRES, not what a
 * widened subject may expand into. The all-outputs fallback fires for the DIRECT
 * producer alone, where the key came from a read and may match nothing because
 * the producer's `Export.Name` is an intrinsic scrub cannot reproduce. One hop
 * up the key is a LITERAL export / output name read out of a template, so a miss
 * there means that template genuinely does not declare it, and widening THERE
 * would refuse the consumer over an unrelated secret two stacks away that no
 * scrub could ever clear.
 *
 * A widened root's subjects DO still expand into hops, deliberately, and the
 * trade is stated rather than hidden (issue #2146 review — an earlier revision
 * of this comment read as if they did not, which contradicted the code). Not
 * expanding them would make an intrinsic-`Export.Name` producer that re-exports
 * a secret undetectable — the exact silent success this walk exists to kill,
 * reintroduced for the one population the widening exists for. Expanding them
 * extends #2133's accepted over-approximation ("it can refuse a stack that
 * imports a non-secret export from a producer that has some other secret
 * output") by one hop, in the direction that repo rule calls safe; and the
 * refusal it produces now names the head of the chain and the order to scrub it
 * in, so it is at least as actionable as the root widening it extends.
 *
 * Residuals, stated rather than hidden. Each keeps the pre-#2133 outcome for
 * that one reference — a possible false CLEAN, never a refusal:
 * - a producer that publishes a secret with NO literal `{{resolve:` and no
 *   followable re-export: one reading it through `Ref` to a parameter, or
 *   re-exporting an export whose producer is outside this app (whose template
 *   scrub never sees), and a producer outside this app at all;
 * - a NON-LITERAL `Fn::ImportValue` argument (an `Fn::Sub`-assembled export
 *   name) and a NON-LITERAL or foreign `Fn::GetStackOutput` `StackName` /
 *   `OutputName`: the hop cannot be resolved statically, and guessing one would
 *   refuse over a reference the walk never established;
 * - a `Fn::GetStackOutput` naming a stack of this app in ANOTHER REGION:
 *   {@link buildExportOwnerIndex} and `producerTemplates` are keyed by stack
 *   NAME alone, so the walk reads that name's template regardless of `Region`;
 * - a secret reachable only through the TRUE branch of an `Fn::If` in a
 *   producer's output: see {@link selectTakenConditionalBranches}, which takes
 *   the FALSE branch for a condition it cannot evaluate -- and which, since
 *   issue [#2150](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2150), feeds BOTH the

 * onward, and {@link producerPublishesSecretExpression}'s literal
 * `{{resolve:` scan, which tests the value itself. Those two are one question
 * asked twice, and they DISAGREED between #2146 and #2150: the hop walk took
 * the false branch while the scan `JSON.stringify`d the whole node and saw
 * both. A producer whose output is
 * `{"Fn::If": ["IsProd", "{{resolve:...}}", "plain"]}` deployed with `IsProd`
 * false therefore verdicted `declared`, the discriminator read the deployed
 * value `plain`, and scrub refused with `SCRUB_CROSS_STACK_PRODUCER_PLAINTEXT`
 * — an UNCLEARABLE refusal, because no `cdkd scrub` of the producer can turn
 * `plain` into an expression and there is no bypass flag, so every other secret
 * in the consumer stack was stranded. A second spelling of the selection would
 * only move where the two can drift apart again, so there is exactly one.
 *
 * WHICH BRANCH: the FALSE one, unconditionally, mirroring `resolveIf`'s
 * unknown-condition arm. Every condition met on this path belongs to ANOTHER
 * stack, and scrub evaluates conditions only for the stack it is scrubbing,
 * from that template's parameter DEFAULTS (it takes no `--parameters`), so a
 * producer's condition is not evaluable here.
 *
 * TWO SHAPES COLLAPSE MORE THAN THE SELECTED BRANCH, both fail-OPEN, both
 * stated rather than implied because the old whole-node `JSON.stringify` saw
 * them and this does not. Neither is CloudFormation-emittable, which is why
 * they are accepted rather than fixed:
 *
 * - a MALFORMED `Fn::If` (args not a 3-tuple) collapses to `null` -- NO branch.

 * name (looked up in `exportOwners`) and an `Fn::GetStackOutput` whose
 * `StackName` and `OutputName` are both literal strings and whose stack is one
 * of this app's. An assembled name resolves to a hop the walk cannot follow,
 * which keeps the pre-#2146 outcome for that value rather than guessing.
 *
 * EVERY owner of a duplicated export name is returned, not the first (issue
 * #2146 review). See {@link buildExportOwnerIndex}: picking one silently
 * decides the verdict on insertion order, and the visited set makes following
 * all of them cheap and terminating.
 *
 * The WHOLE node is walked, not just its top level, because a re-export is
 * routinely wrapped — `Fn::Join`ing an imported password into a URL is the
 * shape the live fixture uses.
 *
 * `Fn::If` NEVER REACHES THIS WALK, and the selection that used to live here
 * is load-bearing rather than tidy (issue #2146 review). `makeCrossStackPrePass`
 * deliberately mirrors
 * `resolveIf` — selected branch only — so that a conditional import of a
 * not-yet-deployed producer cannot refuse a whole stack, unbypassably, over a
 * reference the deploy never read. A hop walk that descended into both arms
 * broke that mirror and produced something worse: a producer whose output is
 * `{"Fn::If": ["IsProd", {"Fn::ImportValue": "ProdSecret"}, {"Fn::ImportValue":
 * "DevPlain"}]}`, deployed in dev with a benign stored value, yielded a
 * `chained` verdict and a refusal NO `cdkd scrub` can clear — nothing can turn
 * that producer's non-secret value into an expression, and there is no bypass
 * flag. On main the same input answered `no`, so it would have been a
 * regression this change introduced.
 *
 * `selectedValue` IS THE CONTRACT, and it is why this function carries no
 * `Fn::If` handling of its own: the only caller,
 * {@link producerPublishesSecretExpression}, applies
 * {@link selectTakenConditionalBranches} ONCE and hands the result to BOTH the
 * literal `{{resolve:` scan and this walk, so a node reaching here holds no
 * `Fn::If` at all. Issue [#2150](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2150)
 * collapsed the two to one site deliberately: the scan used to `JSON.stringify`
 * the whole subject and therefore see BOTH arms while this walk took only the
 * false one, and two spellings of one question are exactly how they came to
 * disagree. A second selection HERE would restore that, and be worse than
 * useless — measured on the #2150 lane, a per-site copy was invisible to every
 * test in the suite, because the caller had already pruned, so deleting it
 * changed nothing and no probe could fence it.
 * {@link selectTakenConditionalBranches}'s own doc carries which branch is
 * selected, what a malformed `Fn::If` yields, and the TRUE-branch residual both
 * halves accept.

 *   The residual is that the FALSE branch is then selected, which that note
 *   already states.
 * - the `!nodeCanRefuse` arm of the cross-stack pre-pass, which debugs and

/**
 * Build the CROSS-STACK pre-pass for ONE stack's scrub (issue
 * [#2133](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2133)).
 *
 * WHY THIS RUNS AT ALL, given the wiring in `scrubStack` already lets the main
 * resolution perform these reads. The wiring is what makes an
 * `Fn::ImportValue`-sourced secret RESOLVE; this pass is what makes a FAILED
 * one LOUD, and what catches a SUCCEEDING one that produced no needle. A
 * cross-stack read that throws inside `resolver.resolve` lands in the caller's
 * best-effort `catch { logger.debug(...) }`, and that catch cannot tell "a
 * `Ref` to a resource that is not in state" — which it exists for — from "the
 * producer's state could not be read", which silently costs the command its
 * needle. Lifting the second class OUT of the catch is the same placement issue
 * #2109 uses for its own refusals, and it keeps the catch doing its job:
 * everything it still swallows is now provably NOT a cross-stack read.
 *
 * THREE OUTCOMES per reference, and the split is the whole design:
 * - the read FAILS for a reason a user can fix (producer not deployed, wrong
 *   reference, an `AccessDenied` on the producer's state or on
 *   `cloudformation:ListExports`, an unassumable `RoleArn`) — REFUSE the stack.
 *   A re-run after the fix scrubs it, so refusing costs reachability only until
 *   the cause is addressed.
 * - the read is DECLINED BY DESIGN (`CrossAccountSecretRefusalError`) — record
 *   an UNVERIFIABLE finding, scrub the rest of the stack, and let the run exit
 *   non-zero. No user action can make that read succeed, so refusing the whole
 *   stack would strand every OTHER secret in it forever — a reachability
 *   regression against the pre-#2133 best-effort behaviour, in the command that
 *   exists to remediate. This is the `secretBearingKeys` treatment (issue
 *   #1919), applied to the same shape of finding: real, reported, unremediable.
 *   The match is on that SUBCLASS, never on `IntrinsicResolutionRefusalError`:
 *   five of its six throw sites are USER-FIXABLE and are reachable from here
 *   whenever a cross-stack node's ARGUMENT is an `Fn::Sub` / `Fn::GetAtt` /
 *   `Fn::Split` (`resolveSub` re-raises the class), so matching the base class
 *   downgraded a fixable refusal to a finding and let scrub print
 *   `No plaintext secrets found` and exit 0 over surviving plaintext.
 * - the read SUCCEEDS but the PRODUCER's own state record still holds the
 *   plaintext, for an export the producer's template declares from a
 *   `{{resolve:...}}` expression — REFUSE, see
 *   {@link plaintextProducerCrossStackReadError}.
 *
 * Each node is resolved on its OWN — `{ [key]: node[key] }` rather than the
 * enclosing object — so a bag carrying an unrelated sibling key cannot make
 * this pass resolve something else, and so a failure names the cross-stack read
 * rather than whatever the whole node resolves to. Which key of a multi-key
 * node is even eligible is decided by {@link RESOLVER_INTRINSIC_PRECEDENCE},
 * mirroring the resolver — so for the CHOICE OF KEY the pass never reads
 * through an intrinsic the main resolution would ignore.
 *
 * That is the whole of the invariant, and it is deliberately narrower than
 * "this pass performs no read the main resolution would not" (issue #2133
 * review — the earlier, overstated wording). `resolveValue` walks a plain
 * object's properties SEQUENTIALLY and aborts the whole bag at the first one
 * that throws, and it THROWS on an unknown intrinsic (`Fn::ToJsonString`,
 * `Fn::ForEach`) before descending into its argument at all; this pass resolves
 * each node on its own and keeps walking in both cases. So it can read a
 * reference the main resolution never reaches — after a sibling `Ref` to a
 * resource absent from state, which is the routine case, or beneath an
 * intrinsic cdkd cannot resolve. The DIRECTION is safe (the deploy made those
 * reads, so refusing over one names a real unscrubbed producer rather than a
 * fabricated one) but the sentence is load-bearing for the refusal, so it is
 * stated as what it is rather than as the stronger claim.
 *
 * The bag is NOT rewritten. The main resolution re-resolves these references
 * itself, and the S3 reads behind them are shared with this pass by the
 * memoizing backend view `scrubStack` builds (issue #2133 review — before that
 * every reference cost `listStacks()` plus up to N `getState()` TWICE). What
 * not rewriting buys back is the whole class of hazard a substituted value
 * carries: a resolved cross-stack value that is itself intrinsic- or
 * reference-shaped would be re-interpreted by the stack's own resolver, which
 * is the shape `SCRUB_SECRET_RESOLUTION_REINTRODUCED_TOKEN` guards against one
 * class over. The needles this records survive the main resolution failing for
 * an unrelated reason, since `recordedSecretValues` is filled in place.
 *
 * `Fn::If` is walked the way {@link IntrinsicFunctionResolver} walks it — the
 * SELECTED branch only, with an unknown condition selecting the FALSE branch,
 * mirroring `resolveIf`. Reading a reference the main resolution would never
 * touch would refuse a stack over a conditional import the deploy never made.
 * A MALFORMED `Fn::If` (args not a 3-tuple) is walked with refusals DISARMED
 * rather than skipped: which branch is live is unknowable, so a read inside it
 * may be one the deploy never made — the exact hazard the selected-branch
 * mirror exists to prevent — but any needle it does yield is still worth having.

    // expression and rewrote it into a reference naming a DIFFERENT output's
    // secret — in the command that exists to remediate the advisory, and
    // republished from there into the exports index.
    //
    // Three rules differ from the engine's on purpose, and all follow from what
    // scrub can KNOW about state some earlier binary wrote:
    //
    // 1. A colliding key gets NO source at all, rather than the owning output's.
    //    The engine just resolved that key's value and knows whose it is; scrub
    //    does not, and in the corrupted-legacy case — the case it exists for —
    //    the alias may well have WON the key. So the key falls to the VALUE
    //    scan, which reads the plaintext actually stored and maps it back to
    //    the expression that produced it — as far as a value scan can, which is
    //    exactly: a WHOLE-value match always, and an EMBEDDED one only for
    //    secrets at or above `secret-redaction`'s minimum needle length. A
    //    short secret embedded in a longer stored value therefore survives this
    //    fallback, and the stack is reported clean; that bound is the value
    //    scan's, not this rule's, but this rule is what exposes the key to it.
    //    That is the pre-#1910 behavior, which
    //    for this key is what the issue calls "weaker but not wrong: it
    //    returned an expression that at least resolved to the value it
    //    replaced". The residual it accepts is stated exactly, because an
    //    earlier revision understated it: when two DISTINCT secrets happen to
    //    resolve to one plaintext, the value map keeps one of them, so the
    //    ambiguous key can be persisted holding a reference naming the OTHER
    //    secret — not merely a lost precision bound. Neither rule dominates
    //    (position can name the wrong secret on this key too, from the other
    //    direction), and the test file pins both sides of the trade.
    //
    // 2. Collisions are tested against every DECLARED output name, conditions
    //    ignored, and an INTRINSIC `Export.Name` is best-effort resolved for
    //    that test alone — see `collectDeclaredOutputNames` for why scrub must
    //    over-approximate here, and note the legacy population is exactly the
    //    binaries that DID resolve intrinsic export names into state keys, so a
    //    literal-only test leaves the original corruption reachable. The
    //    resolved name is never written as a source key: it is only compared.
    //
    // 3. If an intrinsic `Export.Name` cannot be resolved at all, the WHOLE
    //    outputs source bag is dropped and every output key falls to the value
    //    scan. The deploy keyed state under a name scrub then cannot reproduce,
    //    and that name could be ANY output's — so there is no key to mark
    //    ambiguous and no honest way to keep positioning the rest. A residual
    //    remains and is documented rather than hidden: a name that resolves

    // [#2099](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2099)). `state.outputs` is
    // a PERSISTED bag while `outputsTemplateSource` is TODAY's template, so
    // `TEMPLATE_DERIVED_RULES` — "the bag was produced by resolving the
    // source" — is not true of this pair. The two constants differ on
    // `descendArrays` ALONE (`sourceIsSameGeneration` is already false in
    // both), so that flag is the whole question here.
    //
    // **The premise this call site used to rest on is FALSE.** It read: the
    // array arm cannot fire because `outputsTemplateSource[name]` is a template
    // Output's `Value`, "which CloudFormation requires to be a string or an
    // intrinsic OBJECT". CloudFormation does require that; cdkd does not
    // ENFORCE it. `TemplateOutput.Value` is typed `unknown`, the resolver walks
    // an array elementwise with no string coercion, and `StackState.outputs` is
    // deliberately not string-coerced — so a list-valued output (an escape
    // hatch, a hand-written or imported template) puts an array on BOTH sides
    // and the arm IS reachable. The measurement that produced the claim
    // enumerated the shapes CDK emits, not the shapes this code accepts. And
    // this is the pair positional descent is least sound for: the bag is a
    // previous generation's persisted array and the source is today's template
    // array, so a stored literal at index `i` would be rewritten to today's
    // expression at index `i` — `redactByPath` returns a known-secret source
    // leaf VERBATIM — with nothing but equal length connecting the two.
    //
    // **THE TRADE, stated rather than re-decided.** Turning `descendArrays` off
    // gives up a legitimate positional descent, and on the deploy side that
    // cost lands on the 2 of 3 `redactOutputs` sites whose bag WAS freshly
    // resolved from today's template. This call site can never be one of those
    // — its bag is always persisted state — but it does NOT follow that the
    // swap is free here. When state happens to be current, the stored array and
    // the template array line up, and the descent that is now refused would
    // have rewritten an element whose plaintext this run did not record — a
    // value rotated away at its source since the deploy, which the value scan
    // cannot identify and therefore leaves in place. That is the accepted cost;
    // the ORDERING command doc above already tells operators to scrub BEFORE
    // rotating for the same reason. It is bought with the elimination of a
    // FABRICATED expression written into `state.outputs`, which the exports
    // index and `Fn::ImportValue` re-apply VERBATIM to consumer stacks — the
    // #1934 BREAK class, irreversible in a way an unredacted leaf is not.
