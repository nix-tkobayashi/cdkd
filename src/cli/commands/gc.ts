/**
 * `cdkd gc` — garbage-collect unreferenced objects / images from the
 * cdkd-owned asset storage of ONE region (issue #1012).
 *
 * cdkd-owned asset storage (issue #1002) is content-addressed and never
 * deleted on `cdkd destroy` (another stack or a future rollback may
 * reference the same hash), so the asset bucket / container-asset ECR repo
 * grow without bound — and `cdk gc` cannot reach them by design. cdkd can
 * gc them PRECISELY because its state files record exactly which assets
 * are in use.
 *
 * Safety posture (this command DELETES user data — every ambiguity is
 * biased toward NOT deleting):
 *
 * - Names come from the region's bootstrap marker, never recomputed from
 *   the naming convention (custom-name compatibility, issue #1011). No
 *   marker → no ASSET storage in scope; since issue #2052 the run continues
 *   to the state-bucket placeholder sweep rather than ending, and is a
 *   friendly no-op only when neither side has anything. CDK bootstrap
 *   storage (`cdk-hnb659fds-*`) is never touched — that stays `cdk gc`'s
 *   job.
 * - Abandoned `custom-resource-responses/{requestId}.json` placeholders in
 *   the STATE bucket are collected too (issue #2052). Two things make that
 *   the one arm needing its own guard: it is gc's only DESTRUCTIVE call
 *   against the state bucket, and it is ACCOUNT-scoped where every other arm
 *   is region-scoped (the keys carry no region). It matches the producer's
 *   own key shape rather than sweeping the prefix by age alone, so a stack
 *   deployed with a colliding `--state-prefix` cannot have its `state.json`
 *   collected.
 * - The reference scan lists EVERY state file in the WHOLE state bucket
 *   (any `--state-prefix`), and a state file that fails to JSON-parse
 *   aborts the whole run — deleting on partial knowledge is how a live
 *   asset gets deleted.
 * - Any stack lock in the bucket aborts the run: a deploy in flight may
 *   have published assets whose state write has not landed yet.
 * - `--older-than` (default 30d) age-guards every deletion: an object /
 *   image newer than the cutoff is kept even when unreferenced (protects
 *   in-flight publishes and recent rollback targets). Missing timestamps
 *   are treated as "new" (kept).
 * - Every S3 call pins `ExpectedBucketOwner`; a 403 on the asset bucket is
 *   a foreign-bucket refusal like the create / teardown sides.

/**
 * Every AWS partition's URL suffix. The asset-reference matchers match the

 * (issue #1781).
 *
 * Before this list, all three matchers spelled `amazonaws\.com` inline, so a
 * state file written in `aws-cn` / `us-iso*` / `us-isob*` (recording
 * `amazonaws.com.cn` / `c2s.ic.gov` / `sc2s.sgov.gov` hosts) matched none of
 * them and its assets read as UNREFERENCED.
 *
 * **What that actually deleted, measured rather than assumed.** The blast
 * radius is narrower than "every live asset" but still a silent, irreversible
 * delete:
 *
 * - **S3 was already rescued**, by accident. {@link CONTENT_HASH_KEY_RE}
 *   collects `<sha256>.<ext>` tokens out of ANY string regardless of host, and
 *   cdkd's file assets are content-addressed with an extension — so a
 *   non-commercial `https://…amazonaws.com.cn/<sha256>.zip` still had its key
 *   protected by the name-independent pass. Measured on a real `--dry-run`
 *   against a seeded `cn-north-1` state file: 71 of 72 objects, including the
 *   referenced one, were protected with the matchers still broken.
 * - **ECR was NOT rescued, and is where the bug actually deleted.** cdkd's
 *   image tags are bare 64-hex with no `.<ext>` tail, so the content-hash pass
 *   cannot see them, and digests are `sha256:<hex>` — also no tail. With the
 *   ECR matcher missing the suffix, a referenced non-commercial image is
 *   selected for deletion. That is the case the live test reproduced.
 *
 * Either way the failure direction is the opposite of the #1758 / #1745 sites,
 * which merely emit a host that does not resolve.
 *
 * Two properties of this list are load-bearing:
 *
 * - It is the union over ALL partitions, not
 *   `derivePartitionAndUrlSuffix(region).urlSuffix` for the caller's region.
 *   The scan reads EVERY state file in the state bucket, written by any cdkd
 *   binary for any region, so it must match every partition at once; a single
 *   derived literal would still delete a `cn-north-1` stack's images during a
 *   `us-east-1` gc run.
 * - It is a SUPERSET of the arms {@link derivePartitionAndUrlSuffix} knows
 *   (issue #1764). A suffix missing HERE deletes live assets, which is the
 *   irreversible direction, so this list must lead that table rather than
 *   follow it.
 *
 * The superset property is now MECHANICAL rather than hand-maintained (issue
 * #1785): the list is built FROM {@link PARTITION_TABLE} plus
 * {@link GC_EXTRA_URL_SUFFIXES}, so a partition arm added to that table
 * propagates here in the same commit instead of silently outrunning gc. It
 * used to be a hand-written literal, and the test meant to fence it iterated a
 * hand-written region list — so a new arm in the derive table redded nothing.
 *
 * It is a closed SET rather than a `[^/\s]+` wildcard so a look-alike host
 * (`https://<assetBucket>.s3.<region>.example.com/<key>`) is not treated as a
 * cdkd asset reference. That direction only ever over-PROTECTS, but it would
 * also let any string embedding the bucket name pin an object forever, which
 * quietly turns gc into a no-op.
 *
 * NOTE this is a weaker check than `src/utils/ecr-uri.ts`, which CAPTURES the
 * suffix and validates it against the region the host names. That is the right
 * shape there (one host, one caller-known region) and the wrong shape here:
 * the region in a scanned string is not necessarily the region whose partition
 * the suffix must belong to, and pairing them would re-inherit #1764's missing
 * arms on the irreversible side.

 *   `src/utils/ecr-uri.ts` guards its region / suffix checks against —

  //   lower case, so an upper-cased spelling in a byte-compared position is
  //   never this bucket. Matched EXACTLY.
  // - path-style `https://s3.<region>.<suffix>/<bucket>/<key>` — the bucket is
  //   a PATH segment, and S3 compares those byte for byte. Same conclusion, so
  //   also matched EXACTLY.
  // - virtual-hosted `https://<bucket>.s3.<region>.<suffix>/<key>` — the bucket
  //   is the leftmost label of the HOST, and host names are case-insensitive,
  //   so `https://MYBUCKET.s3.<region>.<suffix>/<key>` reaches the SAME live
  //   object as the lower-cased spelling. Missing it is exactly the
  //   irreversible delete issue #1847 exists to close, so this one is FOLDED.

  // Its reach PAST the host is not uniformly harmless, and the three tails

  //   `...@SHA256:AAAA...` reference lands in `imageDigests` in a spelling that
  //   can NEVER match — collected but INERT, i.e. the live image is still
  //   selected for deletion. The flag alone does not protect it; lower-casing on
  //   insert is what does. An OCI digest is defined as lower-case hex, so the
  //   fold cannot merge two distinct digests.
  // - The TAG capture is deliberately NOT folded. ECR tags ARE case-sensitive
  //   (`MyTag` and `mytag` are two tags), so the verbatim capture is the
  //   matching spelling and folding it would create the mirror-image inert
  //   collection.
  // - The `<repo>` segment is matched as an escaped LITERAL and never captured,

 * The trailing group is `*`, NOT `+`, and that is a measurement rather than

 * rendering is shorter than eight characters (`(0.5).toString(36)` is `'0.i'`),
 * so `cdkd-1756180000000-.json` is a real key this provider writes. A `+` here
 * would skip exactly those and the sweep would silently under-collect — a
 * shape filter defeating the sweep it is meant to protect.
 *
 * HOW OFTEN, counted rather than guessed, because sampling cannot answer it (0
 * hits in 5,000,000 `Math.random()` calls). V8 returns `k * 2^-52` for integer
 * `k` in `[0, 2^52)`, and `toString(36)` emits the shortest string that
 * round-trips, so the output is at most 7 characters exactly when some 5-digit

 * in 3.0e8 invocations (e.g. `k = 4503599552889192` renders `0.zzzzz`). Rare per
 * invocation, inevitable across a fleet, and — the part that decides the
 * quantifier — SILENT when missed.
 *
 * Why filter at all: `--state-prefix` is free-form and unvalidated, so a stack
 * deployed with `--state-prefix custom-resource-responses` puts its
 * `state.json`, `lock.json`, `rollback-journal.json` and `deployments/*` INSIDE
 * this prefix. gc builds its own backend on `DEFAULT_STATE_PREFIX` and cannot
 * see that collision, so an age-only sweep would delete live state and orphan
 * every resource in the stack. Matching the producer's own shape is what keeps
 * this command's "bias every ambiguity toward NOT deleting" posture true on the

 * themselves — the issue #2033 replay path via `cleanupResponseObject`, and the
 * FAILED-response arm via `getCustomResourceResponse` / `pollS3Response` — but
 * three shapes leave the key behind and NOTHING collected them:
 *
 *  - an interrupted deploy (Ctrl-C / SIGTERM / a cancelled CI job) between the
 *    PUT and any cleanup;
 *  - any throw on a path that does not reach a cleanup call;
 *  - a LATE handler PUT, landing after cdkd stopped polling. This is the only
 *    one with CONTENT: an empty body is a storage leak, but a real
 *    CloudFormation `Data` payload sitting at a key nothing collects is also a
 *    data-retention question.
 *
 * ## Why age alone is a sufficient staleness rule here
 *
 * The requirement is that a key belonging to an IN-FLIGHT concurrent run is
 * never collected, and two independent things already guarantee it:
 *
 *  1. gc refuses outright while ANY stack holds a lock (the lock guard in
 *     `gcCommand`), and every deploy that can write one of these keys holds
 *     one for its whole duration. A concurrent run does not get this far.
 *  2. `--older-than` (default 30d) is applied to each object's own
 *     `LastModified`, which for a placeholder is the moment of the PUT that
 *     opened the invocation.
 *
 * So this deliberately adds no clock of its own. The two are not ranked, and an
 * earlier version of this note wrongly said (1) was the one that mattered: for
 * a deploy that STARTS between the lock scan and this listing, (1) has already
 * run and only (2) covers it. They close different windows.
 *
 * ## What this widens, stated rather than implied
 *
 * This is gc's first DESTRUCTIVE call against the state bucket — until now it
 * only ever read from it. And unlike every other arm of this command it is
 * ACCOUNT-scoped, not region-scoped: placeholder keys carry no region, so
 * `cdkd gc --region us-east-1` collects ones written by deploys into any
 * region. Both are deliberate (the objects are cdkd's own transient scratch,
 * and a region-scoped sweep could never reach most of them), and both are why
 * the key-shape filter below is not optional.
 *
 * ## Scope
 *
 * Only the DEFAULT prefix. `ProviderRegistry` can be configured with another
 * `responsePrefix`, and nothing persists which one a past deploy used, so gc
 * cannot discover a non-default layout — under-collecting, which is the safe
 * direction, and the reason the constant is shared with the producer rather
 * than re-spelled here.

  //
  // - The CLIENTS need it CANONICAL. SDK endpoint resolution is case-sensitive
  //   (measured in `derivePartitionAndUrlSuffix`'s note: `CN-NORTH-1` resolves
  //   to the COMMERCIAL suffix), so an upper-cased `--region` builds clients
  //   pointing at the wrong partition.
  // - The marker KEY needs BOTH spellings probed. `cdkd bootstrap` derives its
  //   own region verbatim (issue #1820), so `AWS_REGION=US-EAST-1 cdkd
  //   bootstrap` really wrote `cdkd-bootstrap/US-EAST-1.json`. Folding the read
  //   and stopping would MISS that marker where the pre-fold read HIT it, and
  //   gc would report the region as not opted in. The probe below therefore
  //   tries the canonical key first and the raw spelling second — the same
  //   shape `loadBootstrapContainerRepo` uses (`src/cli/commands/
  //   local-state-loader.ts`), and what makes this read independent of when
  //   #1820 aligns the write side.

  // deletes nothing, it just reports "not opted in" for a region that has
  // assets — which is why this is a usability fix rather than a data one.

  // region's marker and delete against another region's endpoints.
  //
  // The sequencing is forced by a dependency: the reconciliation has to ask
  // "does a marker already exist under the old default?", which needs the state
  // backend, which needs the bucket name, which needs the account id. So the
  // account lookup runs against a bag built from the UNRECONCILED region. That
  // is safe and not a shortcut: STS is region-agnostic for
  // `GetCallerIdentity`, and the state backend re-resolves the state bucket's
