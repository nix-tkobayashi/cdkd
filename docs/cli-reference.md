# cdkd CLI Reference

This document covers cdkd-specific CLI flags that need more detail than
fits in the README. For the basic command invocations (`deploy`, `diff`,
`destroy`, `synth`, `list`, `state`, etc.), see the
[Usage](../README.md#usage) section of the README.

## Concurrency

cdkd parallelizes asset publishing, stack deployment, and per-stack
resource provisioning. Each level has its own concurrency knob.

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--concurrency` | 10 | Maximum concurrent resource operations per stack |
| `--stack-concurrency` | 4 | Maximum concurrent stack deployments |
| `--asset-publish-concurrency` | 8 | Maximum concurrent asset publish operations (S3 + ECR push) |
| `--image-build-concurrency` | 4 | Maximum concurrent Docker image builds |

## Wait semantics

cdkd is **template-compatible** with CloudFormation. It is not
**wait-semantics-identical**, and does not claim to be. What counts as
"done" is decided per resource type and documented in the table below.

The decision procedure: where CloudFormation and Terraform agree on the
completion definition, cdkd matches them. Where they disagree, cdkd's
default takes the definition that suits dev/test iteration, and
`--full-wait` opts into the CloudFormation one. This is a rule for
choosing completion definitions, not a promise to mirror any one engine.

Even where both engines wait, cdkd's default may take the fast side —
but only when ALL of these hold (issue
[#1282](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1282)):

1. **No in-deploy consumer**: nothing the same deploy creates or resolves
   (`Fn::GetAtt`, downstream Create calls, post-create verification)
   needs the waited-for state.
2. **No failure signal**: the wait cannot surface an error — a timeout
   means slow, not broken — so waiting buys certainty of *when*, never
   *whether*.
3. **Measurable in both modes**: the comparison tool offers both
   completion definitions, so the benchmark can report two like-for-like
   rows instead of redefining "done" to win one.

`AWS::CloudFront::Distribution` is currently the only type admitted
under this clause. The same test is why a blanket "`--no-wait` by
default" stays rejected: ACM fails (1) outright (an un-issued cert makes
a same-deploy CloudFront / ALB create fail), RDS fails (1) (`Endpoint`
attributes are not final until `available`), and EC2 fails (1) (the
instance-profile attach verification needs a `running` instance).

One documented exception in the other direction:
`AWS::CertificateManager::Certificate` is a "CloudFormation waits,
Terraform does not" case where cdkd's default nonetheless waits. An
un-issued certificate makes a downstream CloudFront / ALB create fail
outright rather than merely arrive early, so the fast side would trade a
wait for a broken deploy. Terraform users express the same wait as a
separate `aws_acm_certificate_validation` resource, which cdkd has no
equivalent of.

Three wait modes, least to most waiting:

| Mode | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--no-wait` | Skip the stabilization waits cdkd performs by default |
| (default) | Wait where the wait is load-bearing (in-deploy consumers / failure detection) |
| `--full-wait` | Also wait everywhere CloudFormation waits |

The two flags are opposite ends of one axis, so **`--no-wait` and
`--full-wait` cannot be combined** (cdkd rejects the pair before any AWS
call). Per-resource-type wait control is not expressible with these
whole-run flags.

Which mode is right depends on whether anything downstream needs the
resource to actually be serving, **not** on where the deploy runs:

- `--no-wait` when nothing runs next and nothing is waiting on completion
  (preview environments, and cutting billed CI minutes is a perfectly
  good reason to use it in CI)
- default for ordinary use
- `--full-wait` when a smoke test, a DNS cutover, or a follow-on job runs
  immediately after the deploy returns

## `--no-wait`

```bash
cdkd deploy --no-wait
```

This can significantly speed up deployments. The resource is fully
functional once AWS finishes the async deployment.

| Resource type | `--no-wait` | Default | `--full-wait` | CloudFormation | Terraform |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AWS::CloudFront::Distribution` | same as default | Return after `CreateDistribution` / `UpdateDistribution` (issue #1282; propagation finishes in the background). Only the SDK provider takes the fast side — a Cloud-Control-routed distribution still polls to the CFn handler's terminal state | Wait for `Deployed` (3–15 min) | Waits | Waits (`wait_for_deployment`, default `true`) |
| `AWS::RDS::DBCluster` / `AWS::RDS::DBInstance` | Return after Create call | Wait for `available` (5–10 min) | same as default | Waits | Waits |
| `AWS::DocDB::DBCluster` / `AWS::DocDB::DBInstance` | Return after Create call | Wait for `available` (5–10 min) | same as default | Waits | Waits |
| `AWS::Neptune::DBCluster` / `AWS::Neptune::DBInstance` | Return after Create call | Wait for `available` (5–10 min) | same as default | Waits | Waits |
| `AWS::ElastiCache::CacheCluster` etc. | Return after Create call | Wait for `available` | same as default | Waits | Waits |
| `AWS::CertificateManager::Certificate` | Return after `RequestCertificate` (cert is `PENDING_VALIDATION`; downstream CloudFront/ALB fail until it issues) | Wait for `ISSUED` (DNS/EMAIL validation) | same as default | Waits | Does not wait (`aws_acm_certificate` returns while `PENDING_VALIDATION`; waiting is a separate `aws_acm_certificate_validation` resource) |
| `AWS::EC2::NatGateway` | Return after `CreateNatGateway` (gateway is `pending`; AWS finishes async) | Wait for `available` (1–2 min) | same as default | Waits | Waits |
| `AWS::EC2::Instance` | Return after `RunInstances` (instance is `pending`; `PublicIp` / `PrivateIp` attributes may be empty, and the IAM instance profile association is not verified — see below) | Wait for `running` (30–60 s) | same as default | Waits for `running` | Waits for `running` |
| `AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::LoadBalancer` | Return after `CreateLoadBalancer` (LB is `provisioning`; `DNSName` 503s until active). Also skips the capacity-reservation stabilize poll below | Wait for `active` (90–180 s). When the template sets `MinimumLoadBalancerCapacity` with `EnableCapacityReservationProvisionStabilize: true`, additionally poll `DescribeCapacityReservation` until every zone is `provisioned` (bounded ~10 min; timeout warns and continues, a `failed` zone errors) | same as default | Waits for `active`; the stabilize flag is the CFn-native opt-in to the same reservation wait | Waits for `active` |
| `AWS::ECS::Service` | same as default | Return after `CreateService` / `UpdateService` | Wait for steady state | Waits for steady state | Does not wait (`wait_for_steady_state`, default `false`) |
| `AWS::Lambda::MicrovmImage` | Return after `CreateMicrovmImage` (image is `CREATING`; the build finishes async). The image ARN is resolved before the wait, so outputs still work. Only the SDK provider honors this — the Cloud Control fallback always polls to a terminal state | Wait for `CREATED` (the Firecracker snapshot build; several minutes) | same as default | Waits | n/a |

For NAT Gateway specifically: `CreateNatGateway` returns the
`NatGatewayId` immediately, so dependent Routes that only need the ID
proceed against a still-`pending` gateway. `--no-wait` is safe when
nothing in the deploy flow needs actual NAT-routed egress (no Lambda
invoked during deploy that hits the internet, etc.).

For EC2 Instance specifically: cdkd normally verifies after launch that the
requested `IamInstanceProfile` really did attach, because `RunInstances`
associates it asynchronously and can complete with NO profile attached when the
profile was created moments earlier (cdkd's fast path creates it ~1 s before
launch; CloudFormation never hits this because its own latency lets IAM settle).
That check needs a `running` or `stopped` instance — AWS rejects
`AssociateIamInstanceProfile` on a `pending` one — so under `--no-wait` it is
skipped and a warning naming the instance is printed instead. If the deploy
needs the profile to be attached, either drop `--no-wait` or verify afterwards:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-iam-instance-profile-associations \
  --filters Name=instance-id,Values=<instance-id>
```

The same hazard applies to an `AWS::EC2::EIP` whose `InstanceId` points at an
instance created in the same deploy: `AssociateAddress` rejects an instance
that is not yet `running`. Under `--no-wait`, creating such an EIP allocates
the address but skips the association; updating one attempts the association
and degrades to a warning only if AWS actually rejects it (so repointing an
EIP at an already-running instance still works). In both cases the warning
prints the exact `aws ec2 associate-address` command to run once the instance
is running.

`--no-wait` is **deploy-only**. `cdkd destroy` does not accept it,
because no destroy code path benefits — NAT Gateway destroy
unconditionally waits for `deleted` state to keep teardown ordered
(a still-`deleting` gateway blocks `DeleteSubnet` /
`DeleteInternetGateway` / `DeleteVpc` with `DependencyViolation`
until its ENI / EIP / route associations release), and the other
`--no-wait`-eligible resources (RDS / ElastiCache) are leaves on the
destroy DAG so their providers don't wait there to begin with.
(CloudFront's destroy-side disable-then-wait is an API requirement —
a distribution must be `Deployed` and disabled before
`DeleteDistribution` succeeds — and is unaffected by any wait flag.)

`--no-wait` only skips *convenience* waits for resources that don't
block siblings within the same deploy. There is one exception that
runs unconditionally regardless of `--no-wait`: a Lambda-backed
`AWS::CloudFormation::CustomResource` waits for its **backing Lambda**
(the ServiceToken Lambda) to reach `Configuration.State === 'Active'`
and `LastUpdateStatus === 'Successful'` immediately before the
synchronous Invoke. Without that wait, an Invoke against a still-Pending
function fails with `The function is currently in the following state:
Pending` (CFn parity). The wait is scoped to the Custom Resource Invoke
itself; ordinary Lambda CREATE / UPDATE returns as soon as the SDK call
returns, so VPC Lambdas with no synchronous downstream consumer don't
block the deploy DAG on the 5–10 min ENI attach window.

## `--full-wait`

```bash
cdkd deploy --full-wait
```

Two types are affected: `AWS::ECS::Service` (steady state) and
`AWS::CloudFront::Distribution` (`Deployed`, issue #1282).

### `AWS::ECS::Service` — steady state

cdkd's default returns once `CreateService` / `UpdateService` is
accepted, which matches Terraform's default and diverges from
CloudFormation on purpose: nothing downstream needs the service to be
steady (`Fn::GetAtt` yields `Name` / `ServiceArn`, both valid
immediately), and CloudFormation's steady-state wait is what makes a
crash-looping image hang a stack for many minutes.

Without `--full-wait`, cdkd prints the exact command to wait manually:

```text
aws ecs wait services-stable --cluster <cluster> --services <service>
```

cdkd deliberately does not probe the rollout on the default path. Right
after `CreateService` a healthy service and a doomed one look identical
(`ACTIVE`, `runningCount: 0`, `rolloutState: IN_PROGRESS`); a warning
there would fire on every deploy and would imply a guarantee ("nothing
was printed, so the rollout is fine") that a single check cannot back.

The steady-state wait is capped at 600 seconds by default (matching
Terraform's `aws_ecs_service` create timeout). A service that
legitimately takes longer — a large task count, a slow-pulling image, a
long health-check grace period — can lift the cap with
`--resource-timeout` (per-type or global), e.g.
`--resource-timeout AWS::ECS::Service=20m`. The flag only raises the
cap, never lowers it below the 600s floor, and the same value already
governs the outer per-resource deadline, so the two cannot undercut
each other.

The `--full-wait` doneness is "stable AND rolled out": after the
steady-state waiter (a single deployment whose running count matches the
desired count), cdkd briefly polls the PRIMARY deployment's
`rolloutState` to `COMPLETED` — ECS flips it a few seconds after the
stability condition is met, and returning inside that window would leave
`--full-wait` observably weaker than CloudFormation's handler. The poll
is bounded (about two minutes); a rollout still in progress past it
warns and continues rather than failing a service that is already
stable.

Under `--full-wait`, a service that never stabilizes fails the deploy. On
create, cdkd best-effort deletes the service it just created before
failing, so the next deploy does not collide on the service name. The
deletion is announced with a warning, and the failure message carries the
`aws ecs list-tasks --desired-status STOPPED` / `describe-tasks` commands
to inspect why the tasks stopped — stopped tasks outlive the service
deletion by about an hour, so the evidence is still there.

### `AWS::CloudFront::Distribution` — `Deployed`

cdkd's default returns once `CreateDistribution` / `UpdateDistribution`
is accepted (issue #1282). Both CloudFormation and Terraform
(`wait_for_deployment`, default `true`) wait for `Deployed` here, so
this is the fast-side clause of the wait-semantics rule in action:
`Fn::GetAtt` (Id / DomainName) is final in the Create/Update response so
nothing in-deploy consumes `Deployed`, and the wait has no failure
signal — a distribution deploy cannot fail, so waiting 3–15 minutes
only buys certainty of *when* the edge propagation finished.

Without `--full-wait`, cdkd prints the exact command to wait manually:

```text
aws cloudfront wait distribution-deployed --id <distribution-id>
```

Under `--full-wait`, the wait budget is ~20 minutes, lifted by an
explicit `--resource-timeout` (per-type or global), e.g.
`--resource-timeout AWS::CloudFront::Distribution=40m` — the flag only
raises the budget, never lowers it, and the same value already governs
the outer per-resource deadline, so the two cannot undercut each other.
Unlike the ECS steady-state timeout, a CloudFront wait timeout does
**not** fail the deploy: a distribution that is still `InProgress` at
the budget is slow, not broken (there is no failure state to detect),
and failing would hand the automatic rollback a healthy distribution to
disable-and-delete. cdkd warns with the manual wait command and
proceeds.

The destroy path is unaffected by all of this: deleting a distribution
requires disabling it and waiting for `Deployed` first (an API
requirement), which also means a distribution created fire-and-forget
and destroyed immediately still tears down cleanly.

A deliberate consequence of this axis: the dev/test-leaning defaults are
a per-run choice, not a capability limit. A pipeline that wants
CloudFormation-parity completion semantics — a smoke-test gate, a
production-leaning promotion step — can bake `--full-wait` into its
deploy invocation as a standing setting and get the strict "done"
everywhere CloudFormation waits.

`--full-wait` is **deploy-only**, like `--no-wait`, and cannot be
combined with it.

## VPC route DependsOn relaxation (default-on)

`cdkd deploy` drops the CDK-injected defensive `DependsOn` edges from
VPC Lambdas (and adjacent IAM Role / Policy / Lambda::Url /
EventSourceMapping resources) onto the private subnet's `DefaultRoute`
/ `RouteTableAssociation` so that downstream consumers — most notably
`CloudFront::Distribution` whose Origin is a Lambda Function URL — can
dispatch in parallel with NAT Gateway stabilization.

This is on by default. The relaxation is safe because all deploy-time
consumers of a VPC Lambda accept it in `Pending` state:
`CreateFunctionUrlConfig` / `AddPermission` / `CreateEventSourceMapping`
all succeed before ENI provisioning finishes, and cdkd's existing
post-`CreateFunction` `State=Active` wait is already moved to
`CustomResourceProvider.sendRequest` (the one consumer that synchronously
invokes the function — see PR #121 follow-up).

To opt out:

```bash
cdkd deploy --no-aggressive-vpc-parallel
```

When you'd want to opt out: a stack with a Custom Resource that
synchronously invokes a VPC Lambda **outside** cdkd's
Lambda-ServiceToken Active wait (e.g. through SNS or via a Step
Functions task), where you want the strict CDK ordering to guarantee
the NAT route is up before the function is hit. Most stacks don't need
this — cdkd's Custom Resource provider already handles the standard
Lambda-ServiceToken case.

**Critical-path effect on a VPC + Lambda + CloudFront stack:**

| Mode | Critical path | Total |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--no-aggressive-vpc-parallel` | NAT 2–3 min → Lambda → Lambda::Url → CF 3 min (serial) | ~6 min |
| **default** | max(NAT, CF) (parallel) | **~3 min** |

Measured −54.6% on `tests/integration/bench-cdk-sample`
(398.59s with `--no-aggressive-vpc-parallel` → 181.03s default).

Note: the "CF 3 min" leg above is the `Deployed` wait, which since
issue #1282 applies only under `--full-wait` — on the current default the
CloudFront leg returns in seconds and the critical path is NAT alone.
The measured numbers predate #1282 (taken with the then-default
`Deployed` wait); the relaxation still matters under `--full-wait` and
for the in-background propagation start time.

**Type-pair allowlist** (only DependsOn edges matching one of these
pairs are dropped — Ref / GetAtt edges and DependsOn outside the list
are untouched):

| Depender (`from`) | Dependee (`to`) |
| --- | --- |
| `AWS::IAM::Role` | `AWS::EC2::Route` / `AWS::EC2::SubnetRouteTableAssociation` |
| `AWS::IAM::Policy` | `AWS::EC2::Route` / `AWS::EC2::SubnetRouteTableAssociation` |
| `AWS::Lambda::Function` | `AWS::EC2::Route` / `AWS::EC2::SubnetRouteTableAssociation` |
| `AWS::Lambda::Url` | `AWS::EC2::Route` / `AWS::EC2::SubnetRouteTableAssociation` |
| `AWS::Lambda::EventSourceMapping` | `AWS::EC2::Route` / `AWS::EC2::SubnetRouteTableAssociation` |

Implementation: [src/analyzer/cdk-defensive-deps.ts](../src/analyzer/cdk-defensive-deps.ts) +
[src/analyzer/dag-builder.ts](../src/analyzer/dag-builder.ts) (gated by the
`relaxCdkVpcDefensiveDeps` `DagBuilderOptions` flag, set on the deploy
code path only — destroy ordering is unaffected).

**Trade-off:** if a Lambda's async ENI provisioning fails *after* the
deploy has already started a CloudFront `CreateDistribution` against
its Function URL, the rollback has to delete both — and CloudFront
delete is also ~5 min. The opt-out exists for stacks where the user
wants to keep that worst case off the table.

The relaxation is **deploy-only**. `cdkd destroy` is unaffected — the
route DependsOn doesn't constrain delete-time correctness (Lambda
hyperplane ENI release is the actual destroy bottleneck and is
handled separately by `lambda-vpc-deps.ts`).

## `--no-capture-observed-state`

`cdkd deploy` records each resource's AWS-current properties into
`ResourceState.observedProperties` (state schema `version: 3`)
immediately after the create/update succeeds, by calling
`provider.readCurrentState()` fire-and-forget. The deploy critical path
does NOT block on these — the in-flight set is drained right before the
final state save, so the cost is roughly `max(per-resource readCurrentState
latency)`, around 200–300ms in practice. Without
this, `cdkd drift` can only compare against `properties` (= what the
user templated), and console-side changes to keys the user did not
template are silently ignored.

```bash
# Skip the observedProperties capture (default ON since v0.47.0)
cdkd deploy --no-capture-observed-state

# Pin in cdk.json so every deploy in the project skips the capture
# {
#   "context": {
#     "cdkd": { "captureObservedState": false }
#   }
# }
```

When the capture is off, drift detection falls back to the pre-`version:
3` behavior — only state-recorded properties are compared. Use the flag
when deploy speed is more important than rich drift detection. The
escape-hatch order is: `--no-capture-observed-state` (CLI) overrides
`cdk.json context.cdkd.captureObservedState` (project) overrides the
default `true`.

### v2 → v3 schema upgrade flow

When `cdkd deploy` loads state and finds resources without
`observedProperties` (typical the first time you deploy after upgrading
from cdkd <0.49 / state schema `version: 2`), it kicks off
`provider.readCurrentState` for each in parallel with the rest of the
deploy and drains the result into state at the final save. The deploy
critical path does NOT wait on these — cost is bounded by the longest
single `readCurrentState` (~200-300ms in practice), once. Subsequent
deploys are unaffected. Honors `--no-capture-observed-state` (skips
both regular capture and this upgrade refresh).

`cdkd state refresh-observed <stack>` remains the manual / non-deploy
path — useful when you want to refresh the baseline without redeploying
(e.g. for resources that won't change in any near-future deploy).

## `--prefix-user-supplied-names` (and deprecated `--no-prefix-user-supplied-names`)

cdkd creates AWS resources with the **exact name you declared** in
CDK code by default. `new iam.Role(this, 'CRRole', { roleName:
'my-role' })` in stack `MyStack` produces an AWS resource named
`my-role`, consistent across every resource type. This is the
default since **v0.94.0** ([#299](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/299)).

Pre-v0.94.0 cdkd prepended the stack name to user-declared physical
names on a subset of types only (Pattern B providers: IAM Role /
User / Group / InstanceProfile / ELBv2 LoadBalancer / TargetGroup),
while Pattern A providers (Lambda, S3, SNS, SQS, DynamoDB, etc.)
used the user's name as-is. The inconsistency was opaque to users;
`cdkd export` (PR #285) surfaced it because the CFn IMPORT identifier
check would reject a synth template whose `RoleName: 'my-role'`
didn't match the AWS-deployed `MyStack-my-role`. Flipping the default
brings every resource type into line out of the box.

`--prefix-user-supplied-names` opts BACK in to legacy prefixing on
Pattern B providers (matching pre-v0.94.0 cdkd). Auto-generated names
(where the user did NOT declare a physical name) keep the prefix
regardless of the flag: those names rely on the prefix for cross-stack
uniqueness.

```bash
# Pass per-invocation (opt back in to legacy prefixing)
cdkd deploy --prefix-user-supplied-names

# Set per-shell
export CDKD_PREFIX_USER_SUPPLIED_NAMES=true
cdkd deploy

# Pin per-project in cdk.json
# {
#   "context": {
#     "cdkd": { "prefixUserSuppliedNames": true }
#   }
# }
```

Resolution chain (highest wins): `--prefix-user-supplied-names` CLI
flag → `CDKD_PREFIX_USER_SUPPLIED_NAMES=true` env var → `cdk.json`
`context.cdkd.prefixUserSuppliedNames: true` → default `false`
(= skip prefix, the v0.94.0 default).

### Deprecated: `--no-prefix-user-supplied-names`

The `--no-prefix-user-supplied-names` CLI flag (plus the
`CDKD_NO_PREFIX_USER_SUPPLIED_NAMES` env var and `cdk.json
context.cdkd.noPrefixUserSuppliedNames`) is still accepted but now
matches the default since v0.94.0. Setting any of them emits a
deprecation warning and has no effect on the resolved name. Pre-v0.94.0
this was how you opted in to skipping the prefix; that opt-in is now
the default.

Remove the flag / env var / cdk.json entry from your config. If you
need to RESTORE pre-v0.94.0 legacy prefixing (e.g. migrating an
existing stack without replacement), use the new
`--prefix-user-supplied-names` opposite-direction flag instead.

### Granularity, storage, mid-flight reversibility

- **Granularity**: per-deploy. The flag is consulted once at command
  start and applied to every per-resource name generation in that
  deploy via an `AsyncLocalStorage`-scoped value.
- **Storage**: the flag controls **what AWS resource cdkd asks AWS to
  create**, not what cdkd records in state — once the AWS resource is
  named, the same name is recorded as `physicalId` in state. Flipping
  the flag after the fact does NOT rename an already-deployed resource.
- **Mid-flight reversibility**: flipping the flag on an existing stack
  causes the next deploy to propose REPLACEMENT on every Pattern B
  resource (IAM Role / User / Group / InstanceProfile / ELBv2 LB / TG)
  that uses a user-declared name — the existing AWS resource has one
  name; the new template intent has the other. The v0.94.0 default
  flip is a one-time instance of this: upgrading from a pre-v0.94.0
  cdkd against an existing stack will propose replacement unless you
  pin `--prefix-user-supplied-names`.

### Affected resource types

The flag only changes behavior for resource types whose pre-v0.94.0
code path prefixed user-supplied names (Pattern B providers). Pattern A
providers were always unprefixed and are unchanged by the flag.

| Pattern | New default (v0.94.0+) | `--prefix-user-supplied-names` (legacy opt-in) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Pattern B**: IAM Role, IAM User, IAM Group, IAM InstanceProfile, ELBv2 LoadBalancer, ELBv2 TargetGroup | Unprefixed (`my-role`) | Prefixed (`MyStack-my-role`) |
| **Pattern A**: Lambda Function, S3 Bucket, SNS Topic, SQS Queue, DynamoDB Table, Logs LogGroup, Events Rule, etc. | Unprefixed (`my-bucket`) | No effect (already unprefixed) |
| Auto-generated names (any type, no user-supplied physical name) | Prefixed (`MyStack-LogicalId-<hash>`) | No effect — prefix kept for uniqueness |

### Migration from pre-v0.94.0

For a stack already deployed under the pre-v0.94.0 default (Pattern B
resources have stack-name-prefixed physical names in AWS), the first
`cdkd deploy` on v0.94.0+ proposes REPLACEMENT on every Pattern B
resource — the AWS-deployed name `MyStack-my-role` no longer matches
the new template intent `my-role`. Three options, listed by preference:

1. **Pin `--prefix-user-supplied-names`** to keep the legacy behavior
   for that stack. Most conservative — no AWS resources touched.
2. **Accept the one-time REPLACEMENT** — the deploy-time pre-flight
   prompt (see next subsection) lists every affected resource and
   defaults to *no*, so the side effect is explicit.
3. **Drop the explicit `roleName` / `userName` / ...** in CDK code,
   letting CDK auto-generate the name. Also a one-time REPLACEMENT,
   but the new name is then stable across future deploys.

A state-side rename helper (`cdkd state rename-strip-prefix <stack>`)
that would migrate state to match AWS without REPLACEMENT is tracked
in [#300](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/300) and not yet
implemented.

### Migration: deploy-time warning when the flag flips an existing stack

Flipping `--no-prefix-user-supplied-names` on against a stack already
deployed under the legacy prefix convention causes cdkd's diff path to
silently propose REPLACEMENT on every affected Pattern B resource —
the AWS-deployed name is `MyStack-my-role` and the new template intent
is `my-role`, so the diff classifies the name as an immutable property
change and the resource is destroyed and re-created. To make this side
effect visible up front, `cdkd deploy` runs a pre-flight migration
check: when the flag is on AND the existing state contains one or
more Pattern B resources whose recorded `physicalId` is EXACTLY the
legacy auto-prefixed form of the user-supplied name
(`${stackName}-${userSuppliedName}`), the command lists them and prompts
for confirmation before any provider call runs. The exact-match test (not
a bare "starts with `${stackName}-`") is deliberate: a user-supplied name
that itself starts with the stack name — e.g. setting `roleName` to
`${this.stackName}-role`, a common convention — is taken verbatim, so its
`physicalId` already equals the user name. There is no rename and no
replacement, so it is NOT flagged (a bare prefix-strip would otherwise
mis-predict `MyStack-role` to `role` and block routine in-place updates).
The prompt defaults to **no** because
the side effect is destructive; pass `-y` / `--yes` (the global CDK
CLI parity flag) to skip the prompt in CI / non-interactive runs. If
the user declines, the deploy exits cleanly with `no resources
modified` — nothing has been touched yet.

The check runs on the state cdkd reads immediately after acquiring the
stack lock (it does not issue a second, pre-lock read of the same
object), so the stack lock is briefly held while the prompt is open and
is released as soon as it is answered either way. Reading under the lock
also means the check sees exactly the state the diff will consume — no
concurrent deploy can change it in between.

Example output:

```text
WARNING: --no-prefix-user-supplied-names will REPLACE 2 resource(s) whose
AWS physical name is still prefixed with the stack name:
  - MyRole (AWS::IAM::Role): MyStack-my-role -> my-role
  - MyLb (AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::LoadBalancer): MyStack-my-lb -> my-lb
These resources will be REPLACED because the new naming convention drops
the stack-name prefix.

Continue? (y/N):
```

The check is a no-op on a first-time deploy (no state to migrate),
when no Pattern B resource is still prefixed (e.g. the stack was
originally deployed with the flag on), or when the flag is off.

## Per-resource timeout

Both `cdkd deploy` and `cdkd destroy` (including `cdkd state destroy`)
enforce a wall-clock deadline on every individual CREATE / UPDATE /
DELETE so a stuck Cloud Control polling loop, hung Custom Resource
handler, or slow ENI release cannot block the run forever.

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--resource-warn-after <duration_or_type=duration>` | `5m` | Warn when a single resource operation has been running longer than this. The live progress line is suffixed with `[taking longer than expected, Nm+]` and a `WARN` log line is emitted (printed above the live area in TTY mode, plain stderr otherwise). Repeatable. |
| `--resource-timeout <duration_or_type=duration>` | `30m` | Abort a single resource operation that exceeds this. The deploy / destroy fails with `ResourceTimeoutError` (wrapped in `ProvisioningError`) and the existing rollback / state-preservation path runs. Repeatable. |

Durations are written as `<number>s`, `<number>m`, or `<number>h`
(e.g. `30s`, `90s`, `5m`, `1.5h`). Zero, negative, missing-unit, and
unknown-unit values are rejected at parse time.

Both flags accept either form on each invocation:

- **Bare duration** (`30m`) sets the global default. The last bare value wins.
- **`TYPE=DURATION`** (`AWS::CloudFront::Distribution=1h`) adds a per-resource-type override that supersedes the global default for that type only.

`TYPE` must look like `AWS::Service::Resource`; malformed types are
rejected at parse time. `warn < timeout` is enforced both globally and
per-type — so `--resource-warn-after AWS::X=10m --resource-timeout AWS::X=5m`
is a parse-time error.

When the user passes `--resource-timeout` (global or per-type) shorter
than the inherited 5m `--resource-warn-after` default and does NOT pass
a matching `--resource-warn-after`, cdkd auto-lowers the warn-after to
`min(5m, 0.5 * timeout)` and emits a `WARN` log line naming the lowered
value. This closes the UX gap where a `--resource-timeout 2m` invocation
would otherwise fail every resource at runtime with
`InvalidResourceDeadlineError: warnAfterMs must be less than timeoutMs`.
Passing both flags explicitly disables the auto-lowering — a reversed
explicit pair is a hard parse-time error.

```bash
# Surface "still running" warnings sooner on a fast-feedback dev loop
cdkd deploy --resource-warn-after 90s --resource-timeout 10m

# Keep the global default tight, raise it only for resources known to take longer
cdkd deploy \
  --resource-timeout 30m \
  --resource-timeout AWS::CloudFront::Distribution=1h \
  --resource-timeout AWS::RDS::DBCluster=1h30m

# Force Custom Resources to abort earlier than their 1h self-reported polling cap
cdkd deploy --resource-timeout AWS::CloudFormation::CustomResource=5m
```

### Why the default is 30m, not 1h

cdkd's Custom Resource provider polls async handlers
(`isCompleteHandler` pattern) for up to one hour before giving up.
Setting the per-resource timeout to 1h by default would make a single
hung non-CR resource hold the whole stack for an hour even though no
other resource type ever needs more than a few minutes. The 30m global
default catches stuck operations faster.

For Custom Resources specifically, the provider self-reports its 1h
polling cap to the engine via the `getMinResourceTimeoutMs()`
interface — the deploy engine resolves the per-resource budget as
`max(provider self-report, --resource-timeout global)`, so CR resources
get their full hour automatically without the user having to remember
`--resource-timeout 1h`. To force CR to abort earlier than its
self-reported cap, pass an explicit per-type override
(`--resource-timeout AWS::CloudFormation::CustomResource=5m`). Per-type
overrides always win over the provider's self-report — they're the
documented escape hatch.

Both DynamoDB types (`AWS::DynamoDB::Table`, `AWS::DynamoDB::GlobalTable`)
self-report 30 minutes for the same reason — their DELETE path stacks
several polling waits (replica removal, an index-settle gate, an
index-busy `DeleteTable` retry, a confirm-gone wait) that share ONE
allowance sized to fit inside it. At the default `--resource-timeout 30m`
this changes nothing. Note the self-report is per TYPE, not per
operation, so lowering the global default below 30m for fail-fast CI
(`--resource-timeout 5m`) does NOT shorten these types' CREATE or UPDATE
deadline either; the per-type override
(`--resource-timeout AWS::DynamoDB::Table=5m`) is the way to get the
shorter deadline back.

A handful of resource types are ALSO known to be slow to create or
delete regardless of provider — an `AWS::OpenSearchService::Domain`
deletion routinely runs 15-30 minutes, and Redshift / ElastiCache / RDS
clusters are the same class. cdkd carries a built-in 60-minute floor for
these (`src/provisioning/slow-cc-operation-timeouts.ts`), folded into the
same `max(...)` resolution above, so a default `cdkd destroy` waits long
enough for the delete to actually finish instead of aborting mid-delete.
The same floor lifts the Cloud Control provider's internal poll cap (a
flat 15 minutes otherwise), so a Cloud-Control-routed slow delete is not
cut off before the outer deadline. An explicit
`--resource-timeout <TYPE>=<DURATION>` override still wins.

The flag reaches SDK-provider inner waiters the same way: under
`--full-wait`, the ECS Service steady-state waiter's 600s cap is lifted
to `max(600s, resolved --resource-timeout)` and the CloudFront
Distribution `Deployed` wait budget to `max(20min, resolved
--resource-timeout)` (see the `--full-wait` section above), so the inner
waiters can never abort before the outer per-resource deadline the same
flag raised.

The error message on timeout names the resource, type, region, elapsed
time, and operation, and reminds you that long-running resources
self-report their needed budget — when you see CR time out, the cause
is genuinely the handler, not too-tight a default:

```text
Resource MyBucket (AWS::S3::Bucket) in us-east-1 timed out after 30m during CREATE (elapsed 30m).
This may indicate a stuck Cloud Control polling loop, hung Custom Resource, or
slow ENI provisioning. Re-run with --resource-timeout AWS::S3::Bucket=<DURATION>
to bump the budget for this resource type only, or --verbose to see the
underlying provider activity.
```

Note: `--resource-warn-after` must be less than `--resource-timeout`.
Reversed values are rejected at parse time.

## `--allow-unsupported-types` (deploy + destroy)

cdkd rejects genuinely-unsupported resource types at **pre-flight** —
before any resource is touched — instead of letting them fail mid-deploy
with an opaque Cloud Control error. A type is "unsupported" when AWS
reports it as `ProvisioningType: NON_PROVISIONABLE` (the provider-coverage
**Tier 3** set: Cloud Control API cannot create/update/delete it) AND cdkd
has no SDK provider for it. The Tier 3 set is generated from the audit
cache into the runtime at `src/provisioning/unsupported-types.generated.ts`
(`vp run gen:unsupported-types`; CI fails if it drifts).

When pre-flight hits one, the error names each type, the reason, a 1-click
pre-filled GitHub issue link to request support, and the exact re-run
command:

```text
The following resource types are not supported by cdkd:
  - AWS::AppMesh::Mesh
      AWS reports this type as NON_PROVISIONABLE (Cloud Control API cannot
      manage it) and cdkd has no SDK provider for it.
      Request support: https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/new?title=...

To attempt deployment anyway (Cloud Control will likely fail for
NON_PROVISIONABLE types), re-run with: --allow-unsupported-types AWS::AppMesh::Mesh
```

`--allow-unsupported-types <types>` is the **escape hatch**: a
comma-separated (and repeatable) list of types to attempt via Cloud
Control anyway. It is per-type rather than a blanket override so you
explicitly acknowledge each type. Useful mainly for a type the cached
audit marks Tier 3 that AWS has since made provisionable (regenerate the
audit with `vp run audit:coverage:regenerate` for the permanent fix). It
is available on both `cdkd deploy` and `cdkd destroy` (and `cdkd state
destroy`) so a stack deployed with the flag can also be torn down.

```bash
cdkd deploy MyStack --allow-unsupported-types AWS::AppMesh::Mesh,AWS::Budgets::Budget
cdkd destroy MyStack --allow-unsupported-types AWS::AppMesh::Mesh,AWS::Budgets::Budget
```

## `--allow-unsupported-properties` (deploy)

When a CDK template uses a **top-level CFn property** that cdkd's SDK
provider would silently drop on write (e.g. AWS adds `CapacityProviderConfig`
to `AWS::Lambda::Function`, CDK adds support, you write it in your CDK code,
but `LambdaFunctionProvider.create()` does not read it yet), cdkd **auto-routes
the resource through Cloud Control API** by default (issue #614). Cloud
Control forwards the full property map to AWS verbatim, so the silent
drop is closed without any user intervention — the field reaches AWS.

The routing decision is recorded on the resource's state record as
`provisionedBy: 'cc-api'` and stays sticky for the resource's lifetime
(`cdkd drift`, `cdkd destroy`, etc. route through the same layer that
created it — even if cdkd later adds first-class SDK provider support
for the property). `cdkd state show <stack>` displays the
`ProvisionedBy:` field so you can audit which layer owns each resource.

The set of handled vs silently-dropped properties is generated from the
CFn schema fixtures + each SDK provider's `handledProperties` /
`unhandledByDesign` declarations into the runtime at
`src/provisioning/property-coverage.generated.ts` (`vp run gen:property-coverage`;
CI fails if it drifts). Coverage is per Tier 1 (SDK provider) type only —
Tier 2 (Cloud Control fallback) types already forward the full property
map to AWS, so the auto-route is a no-op for them.

When the auto-route fires, cdkd logs an info line per affected resource:

```text
[info] MyLambda (AWS::Lambda::Function): routing via Cloud Control API
       (cdkd's SDK Provider does not yet wire CapacityProviderConfig — CC API
        will forward the full property map. Override via
        --allow-unsupported-properties AWS::Lambda::Function:CapacityProviderConfig.)
```

### `--allow-unsupported-properties <entries>` (override)

The flag is the **opt-out** from the default CC auto-route. Each entry
is a `<ResourceType>:<PropertyName>` token (comma-separated and
repeatable); the flag pins the resource to the SDK provider path and
**accepts the silent drop** for the named property. A warn line is
logged so the silent drop is auditable.

```bash
cdkd deploy MyStack --allow-unsupported-properties AWS::Lambda::Function:CapacityProviderConfig,AWS::Lambda::Function:FunctionScalingConfig
```

Per type+property pair (not blanket) so you explicitly acknowledge each
silent drop. The flag is `deploy`-only — destroy uses the per-resource
physical ID and the state-recorded `provisionedBy` layer, not the
template properties.

Properties that do not appear in the CFn schema pass through silently —
these are usually `addPropertyOverride` escape hatches or typos, both of
which CFn itself tolerates. Read-only properties (AWS-managed Arns, Ids,
etc.) also pass through silently; you cannot set them from the template
side and they are no-ops if they appear there.

### When to use the override flag (auto-route opt-out guidance)

The auto-route is the default because silent drop is a real bug class
(the deployed resource is missing fields the user wrote). Cloud Control
closes the bug by forwarding the full property map. The flag is the
**opt-out** for situations where you specifically want the SDK provider
path even at the cost of the silent drop.

#### Use the flag when

- **You need the SDK provider's fast synchronous-AWS-call path** and the
  dropped property is non-essential for your use case (e.g. a structural
  CDK construct emits a property you do not care about).
- **A Cloud Control side-effect bothers you** — e.g. CC names a resource
  differently than cdkd's SDK provider would have, and you want the SDK
  naming convention to win.
- **You have an existing SDK-managed resource** (`provisionedBy: 'sdk'`)
  that you want to keep on the SDK path even after a new property
  appears in the template. Without the flag, the next deploy would
  auto-route it through CC (the routing decision re-evaluates per
  deploy — only a resource whose state already says `'cc-api'` is
  sticky to CC; a still-SDK resource with new silent-drop properties
  re-routes).

#### Do NOT use the flag when

- **The dropped property is security-meaningful** — e.g. `KmsKeyArn`,
  `MonitoringRoleArn`, `MasterUserSecret`, IAM policy attachments,
  resource-policy fields, encryption settings, TLS configuration.
  Silent drop here is a real-world incident. Without the flag, the
  auto-route closes the silent drop by sending the property to AWS via
  CC; with the flag, you opt back into the silent drop.
- **You are prototyping** and don't care about routing — the default
  auto-route already gets the property to AWS.

#### Decision summary

| Situation | Recommended action |
| --- | --- |
| Fresh deploy, template uses a silent-drop property | Default auto-route via Cloud Control (no flag needed) |
| Existing CC-managed resource, want to stay on CC | Default routing (sticky) — no flag needed |
| Existing SDK-managed resource, new silent-drop property appears | Default re-routes through CC. To stay on SDK, use `--allow-unsupported-properties` |
| You explicitly want SDK semantics + accept the silent drop | This flag |
| Property is security-meaningful | Do not use the flag — let the CC auto-route close the silent drop |

#### What the flag is NOT

- **NOT** a request to cdkd to start handling the property. The provider
  is unchanged; with the flag, the property is silently dropped at write
  time. (Without the flag, the resource takes the CC route and the
  property reaches AWS verbatim.)
- **NOT** persisted in cdkd state. Every deploy must pass the flag if
  the override is still desired; the resource's `provisionedBy` state
  field reflects the routing actually used at last deploy.

cdkd is currently a dev/test tool (see "Important Notes" in CLAUDE.md);
the CC auto-route closes a long-standing silent-drop bug class by
default. For production workloads, use the AWS CDK CLI until cdkd's
property coverage matches your needs.

## `--recreate-via-cc-api <LogicalId>` + `--force-stateful-recreation` (deploy)

`--recreate-via-cc-api <LogicalId>` (repeatable, one flag per resource)
destroys + recreates the named resource via Cloud Control API in this
deploy, so a previously-silent-dropped top-level CFn property reaches
AWS on the recreated copy. This is the mid-life counterpart to #614's
default-on auto-route for fresh deploys.

When to use it:

- An existing resource is `provisionedBy: 'sdk'` in cdkd state, and you
  want to start using a top-level CFn property cdkd's SDK provider does
  not yet wire (e.g. adding `CapacityProviderConfig` to an already-deployed
  Lambda). Adding the property on the next deploy alone won't reach AWS
  — the SDK update path drops it silently. The flag forces a destroy +
  recreate cycle so the new physical resource lands on CC and the
  property reaches AWS.

When NOT to use it:

- The resource is already `provisionedBy: 'cc-api'` (sticky). The
  update path already routes via CC; the recreate is a no-op. As of
  #665 cdkd refuses pre-flight with `blockedAlreadyCcApi` — the
  destroy + recreate cycle would produce identical end state at the
  cost of unnecessary downtime. Mirror of the `blockedAlreadySdk`
  refusal on the reverse direction (#651). Fix: drop the flag for that
  resource.
- Fresh deploy (the resource is not yet in cdkd state). #614's
  auto-route handles fresh silent-drop deploys automatically — no flag
  needed.

```bash
# Recreate a single Lambda (stateless, no extra flag needed)
cdkd deploy MyStack --recreate-via-cc-api MyLambda --yes

# Recreate two Lambdas in one deploy (repeat the flag — comma-split is intentionally unsupported)
cdkd deploy MyStack \
  --recreate-via-cc-api MyLambda \
  --recreate-via-cc-api OtherFn \
  --yes

# Recreate a stateful resource — TWO flags required + data loss is acknowledged
cdkd deploy MyStack \
  --recreate-via-cc-api MyTable \
  --force-stateful-recreation \
  --yes
```

### Stateful-resource guard

The flag refuses to operate on resource types that carry user data
without `--force-stateful-recreation`. Two-flag protection mirrors the
`--remove-protection` pattern.

Guard list (always stateful — destroy loses ALL data, no automatic
migration):

| Category | Types |
| --- | --- |
| Database / storage | `AWS::RDS::DBInstance`, `AWS::RDS::DBCluster`, `AWS::DocDB::DBInstance`, `AWS::DocDB::DBCluster`, `AWS::Neptune::DBInstance`, `AWS::Neptune::DBCluster`, `AWS::DynamoDB::Table`, `AWS::DynamoDB::GlobalTable` |
| Filesystem / blob | `AWS::EFS::FileSystem`, `AWS::FSx::FileSystem`, `AWS::ECR::Repository`, `AWS::EC2::Volume` |
| Streaming | `AWS::Kinesis::Stream` |
| Search | `AWS::Elasticsearch::Domain`, `AWS::OpenSearchService::Domain` |
| Identity / config | `AWS::Cognito::UserPool`, `AWS::SecretsManager::Secret`, `AWS::SSM::Parameter` |
| Metadata catalog | `AWS::Glue::Database`, `AWS::Glue::Table` |
| Edge | `AWS::CloudFront::Distribution` (URL changes break consumers; ~20-minute propagation) |

Conditionally stateful (guard fires only when the resource actually
contains data):

- `AWS::S3::Bucket` — guard fires when the bucket has at least one
  current version, prior version, or delete-marker. cdkd issues a
  single-page `s3:ListObjectVersions(MaxKeys=1)` against each S3 bucket
  target at plan time (issue #648); empty buckets pass through,
  non-empty buckets (including versioned buckets whose current keys are
  soft-deleted but whose history is still retained) are refused unless
  `--force-stateful-recreation` is supplied. cdkd uses
  `ListObjectVersions` rather than `ListObjectsV2` so the probe's
  view of "empty" matches what the destroy + recreate cycle would
  actually wipe. If the probe itself fails (permission denied,
  transient network error), cdkd logs a warn and falls through to the
  conservative "not stateful" sync result — pass
  `--force-stateful-recreation` to proceed when the bucket might hold
  data and the probe could not be verified.
- `AWS::Logs::LogGroup` — guard fires when `RetentionInDays > 0` on the
  recorded state. Log groups without retention configured are treated
  as ephemeral.

There is no per-resource granularity on `--force-stateful-recreation`
— when set, EVERY named recreate target bypasses the stateful guard.
The user is opting into a footgun; per-resource force would imply a
false sense of granularity.

### Interactive confirmation

`cdkd deploy --recreate-via-cc-api <id>` prints a per-target plan
(logical id + resource type + `stateful` reason where applicable) and
then asks `Continue? (y/N)` before any AWS call. Default is `N`
(destructive — the destroy + recreate cycle is irreversible per
resource). Combine with `--yes` / `-y` for non-interactive CI runs;
the plan is then warn-logged once and the deploy proceeds without
prompting. Non-TTY runs without `--yes` are rejected with an
actionable error rather than hanging on a closed stdin.

For stateful targets (those reaching pre-flight only because the user
opted in with `--force-stateful-recreation`), the prompt prefixes each
row with `**DATA LOSS**` and emits an explicit `DATA: all data in
<logical id> will be lost` caveat — the third "stop and think" moment
on top of the two-flag opt-in.

### Cross-stack reference propagation

The recreated resource gets a fresh physical id. Downstream stacks that
read this resource's outputs via `Fn::GetStackOutput` /
`Fn::ImportValue` must be re-deployed before they see the new id. A
warn line lists this caveat at recreate time; cdkd does NOT walk the
state bucket to enumerate downstream consumers in v1 (deferred to a
follow-up issue). Plan multi-stack recreates from leaf to root.

### Interaction with `--allow-unsupported-properties`

`--recreate-via-cc-api MyLambda` combined with
`--allow-unsupported-properties AWS::Lambda::Function:CapacityProviderConfig`
on a resource whose template carries `CapacityProviderConfig` is **ambiguous
intent**:

- Does the user want SDK + silent drop (override path)?
- Does the user want CC migration (recreate path)?

cdkd refuses with a pre-flight error naming the overlap. Pick one
strategy per resource.

### Reversibility (one-way at v1)

Once a resource is `provisionedBy: 'cc-api'`, going back to the SDK
Provider requires another flag (the inverse `--recreate-via-sdk`). NOT
in scope for v1 — file an issue if you need this direction.

When a backfill PR (issue #609) wires the property the user originally
needed, the migrated resource stays on CC unless the user explicitly
switches it back. Sticky-state semantics avoid SDK↔CC ping-pong on
every backfill release.

### What `--recreate-via-cc-api` is NOT

- **NOT** a per-stack shortcut. There is no
  `--recreate-via-cc-api-all-with-silent-drops` form — the user names
  each target explicitly to acknowledge the cost.
- **NOT** persisted in cdkd state. The next deploy WITHOUT the flag
  routes the recreated resource via CC (sticky); the flag is only
  needed to trigger the initial destroy + recreate.
- **NOT** compatible with cross-account / cross-region migration —
  the flag operates within the current deploy's environment only.
- **NOT** compatible with Tier 3 (`NON_PROVISIONABLE`) types — CC API
  can't handle them either; the existing Tier 3 reject fires first.
- **NOT** compatible with multi-region resources like
  `AWS::DynamoDB::GlobalTable` in v1 — the destroy + recreate cycle
  across replica regions is more involved; cdkd refuses with a clear
  error.

## `--replace` (deploy)

Replace (DELETE + CREATE) a resource whose **in-place update is rejected
because an immutable property changed and AWS exposes no update API for
it**. Some resource types are immutable on AWS — there is no
`Update<Thing>` call, so any property change must publish / register a
new physical resource. Examples: `AWS::Lambda::LayerVersion` content,
`AWS::EFS::AccessPoint`, `AWS::ECS::TaskDefinition`,
`AWS::Glue::SecurityConfiguration`, and several `AWS::ApiGatewayV2::*`
identity fields.

For a few of these cdkd already has a built-in replacement rule (e.g.
`AWS::Lambda::LayerVersion` auto-replaces with no flag). For the rest,
cdkd's diff classifies the change as an in-place UPDATE, the provider's
`update()` hard-rejects with `ResourceUpdateNotSupportedError`, and —
without this flag — the deploy fails. `--replace` opts into catching that
rejection and falling back to a DELETE + CREATE of the resource (the same
replacement path the Cloud Control `UnsupportedActionException`
auto-fallback already uses), matching what CloudFormation would do.

Unlike `--recreate-via-cc-api` / `--recreate-via-sdk-provider` (which
name a specific logical id and force a routing migration), `--replace` is
a stack-wide opt-in that fires only for resources whose update genuinely
hard-rejects — a resource whose update succeeds in place is unaffected.

```bash
# A Glue SecurityConfiguration's EncryptionConfiguration changed (immutable) —
# fails without the flag, replaces cleanly with it
cdkd deploy MyStack --replace --yes
```

### Stateful-resource guard (shared with `--recreate-via-cc-api`)

`--replace` shares the same stateful-resource guard as
`--recreate-via-cc-api`: when the replacement target is a stateful type
(see the guard list above — RDS / DynamoDB / EFS / S3-with-data /
Logs-with-retention / etc.), the DELETE + CREATE loses all data, so
cdkd refuses unless `--force-stateful-recreation` is ALSO passed. The
guard is evaluated at the moment the immutable-update rejection is
caught (mid-deploy), and the error names the resource + the data-loss
reason. Non-stateful immutable types (LayerVersion, Glue
SecurityConfiguration, ECS TaskDefinition, ApiGatewayV2 sub-resources,
etc.) replace with `--replace` alone.

The same stateful guard ALSO covers **property-driven replacement** — a
replacement cdkd detects directly from the diff (an immutable / createOnly
property changed in the template, e.g. `AWS::EFS::FileSystem.PerformanceMode`,
an `AWS::EC2::Volume` `AvailabilityZone` move, or an S3 `BucketName` rename)
rather than from a provider's mid-deploy update rejection. A plain `cdkd deploy` (no `--replace` flag) that would DELETE+CREATE
a **stateful** resource because of such a change now requires
`--force-stateful-recreation` and throws `STATEFUL_REPLACE_BLOCKED` without it,
closing the prior footgun where a template immutable-property change silently
destroyed a stateful resource's data. Non-stateful types still replace freely
on `cdkd deploy` with no flag.

## `--recreate-via-sdk-provider <LogicalId>` (deploy)

`--recreate-via-sdk-provider <LogicalId>` (repeatable, one flag per
resource) is the reverse direction of `--recreate-via-cc-api`
(issue #651). It destroys + recreates the named resource via cdkd's
SDK Provider so a resource currently sticky on `provisionedBy: 'cc-api'`
flips back to `provisionedBy: 'sdk'`.

When to use it:

- A `provisionedBy: 'cc-api'`-sticky resource (landed on CC because
  the user originally needed a top-level CFn property cdkd's SDK
  Provider did not wire, e.g. Lambda `LoggingConfig`) is now eligible
  for SDK Provider routing because a #609 backfill release has added
  SDK coverage for that property. The flag forces a destroy + recreate
  cycle so the new physical resource lands on SDK and benefits from
  SDK Provider performance / diagnostic clarity / narrower IAM scope.
- A `provisionedBy: 'cc-api'` resource where the user no longer needs
  the CC route (e.g. removed the silent-drop property from the
  template) and wants to consolidate routing back to SDK for the
  reasons above.

When NOT to use it:

- The resource is already `provisionedBy: 'sdk'` (or pre-v7 legacy
  state, treated as SDK by the v7 binary) — the reverse migration is
  a no-op. cdkd refuses with a clear error.
- The resource type has no SDK provider registered (Tier 2 CC-only) —
  the destroy + recreate would route via CC again. cdkd refuses.
- The template still uses a silent-drop property NOT in
  `--allow-unsupported-properties` — the default-on CC auto-route
  would re-route the SDK-recreated resource back to CC on the very
  next routing decision. cdkd refuses (inverse ambiguous intent); fix
  by either removing the property from the template or accepting the
  silent drop via `--allow-unsupported-properties <Type>:<Prop>`.

Stateful-resource guard, multi-region refusal, and the interactive
`Continue? (y/N)` prompt are symmetric to `--recreate-via-cc-api`:
named stateful targets (RDS / DynamoDB / S3-with-data / etc.) refuse
unless `--force-stateful-recreation` is also passed, multi-region
resources (`AWS::DynamoDB::GlobalTable`) refuse outright in v1, and
the prompt fires per-stack with the same `**DATA LOSS**` prefix on
stateful entries. The two flags are mutually exclusive on a per-resource
basis — naming the same logical id in both is refused as ambiguous.

```bash
# Mid-life CC→SDK migration after a #609 backfill landed SDK coverage
# for Lambda's LoggingConfig:
cdkd deploy MyStack --recreate-via-sdk-provider MyLambda --yes

# Multiple targets:
cdkd deploy MyStack \
  --recreate-via-sdk-provider MyLambda \
  --recreate-via-sdk-provider OtherFn \
  --yes
```

### What `--recreate-via-sdk-provider` is NOT

- **NOT** a per-stack shortcut. Per-resource explicit naming only.
- **NOT** the only path to SDK routing — fresh CREATEs route via the
  routing-decision matrix in `ProviderRegistry.getProviderFor` and
  land on SDK whenever an SDK Provider is registered for the type AND
  the template has no silent-drop property. This flag is for the
  existing-state CC → SDK migration only.
- **NOT** compatible with `--recreate-via-cc-api` on the same logical
  id — pick ONE direction per resource.

## `--strict-getatt` (deploy)

Fail the deploy on ANY `Fn::GetAtt` that falls back to the resource's
physical ID because cdkd cannot construct the requested attribute, and on
any stack Output that cannot be resolved.

```bash
cdkd deploy MyStack --strict-getatt
```

### Default behavior (without the flag)

When a template requests an attribute that is neither captured in state
`attributes` nor constructible by the resolver's per-type mappings, cdkd
falls back to the resource's **physical ID**:

- **Knowably-wrong shapes hard-fail even without the flag** (issue #1106):
  an attribute name ending in `Arn` whose fallback value is not
  `arn:`-shaped, or ending in `Url` whose fallback is not an http(s) URL,
  cannot be what CloudFormation would return — the deploy fails with an
  actionable error naming the resource, attribute, and an issue link. This
  applies to the resolver's final unknown-type fallback AND to every
  per-type handler's unknown-attribute default branch (issue #1111).
- **Every other suffix warns and returns the physical ID** (`Unknown
  attribute X for resource type Y, returning physical ID`) — an alias or
  endpoint is shape-indistinguishable from a plain name, so a hard-fail
  there would risk failing correct deploys.
- **The same refusals apply inside `Fn::Sub`** (issue #1740). A
  `${LogicalId.Attribute}` placeholder resolves through the same code path,
  so a reference that hard-fails as a resource property hard-fails there
  too. Before that fix `Fn::Sub` downgraded EVERY resolution failure to a
  warning and kept the raw `${...}` text, so the identical reference shipped
  a literal `${MyResource.SomeArn}` to AWS on a green deploy. A variable
  that genuinely does not exist still warns and keeps its placeholder — the
  long-standing behavior — and the warning now names the actual reason
  instead of always saying `not found`.
- When at least one such fallback happened, the deploy summary prints a
  one-line count so the warns don't scroll away on green deploys:

  ```text
  2 attribute resolution(s) fell back to the physical ID (potentially wrong values); re-run with --strict-getatt to fail on these
  ```

  Each distinct fallback site is counted once per run (diff-phase
  resolutions are not double-counted against provisioning-phase ones). The
  count is per stack: a nested-stack child's fallbacks are counted by the
  child's own deploy engine and are not aggregated into the parent's
  summary line.

- An **Output** whose value cannot be resolved is warned about and skipped
  (no value is persisted or exported); the deploy still exits 0.

### With `--strict-getatt`

- EVERY unknown-attribute physical-ID fallback — any suffix, including an
  ARN-shaped fallback for an `*Arn` attribute — is a hard error.
- An Output resolution failure fails the deploy instead of silently
  publishing nothing (which would otherwise break downstream
  `Fn::ImportValue` consumers with "export not found" long after this
  deploy exited 0). The failure fires AFTER all resource operations
  succeeded, so cdkd persists the provisioning result to state BEFORE
  failing: the created/updated resources are recorded (previously
  persisted outputs are kept), no rollback runs, and a follow-up
  `cdkd deploy` or `cdkd destroy` sees them — even on a first deploy,
  nothing becomes an invisible orphan.

Use it in CI to guarantee no potentially-wrong `Fn::GetAtt` value ever
ships quietly; drop it (default) when a known-benign fallback (e.g. a
physical ID that genuinely is the attribute value for a type cdkd has not
enriched yet) is acceptable. Nested-stack child deploys inherit the flag
from the parent deploy.

## `--allow-unaddressed` (deploy)

A deploy that finishes without a single resource FAILING can still leave a
resource cdkd was responsible for alive in AWS. Since issue
[#1960](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1960) that outcome exits `2`,
matching what `cdkd destroy` has done for the identical case since
[#1752](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1752). Two cases produce it, and
they differ in whether they heal themselves:

| Summary row | Cause | Next `cdkd deploy` retries it? |
|---|---|---|
| `Skipped (not deleted): N` | a resource removed from the template whose provider could not issue the delete — typically a malformed `physicalId` in state (issue [#1762](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1762)) | **Yes.** The state record is deliberately KEPT, so the resource is still diffed as a DELETE next run |
| `of which left an orphaned predecessor: N` | a replacement whose new resource was created and whose OLD one could not be deleted (issue [#1819](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1819)) | **No.** State now points at the replacement, so the survivor is untracked — delete it by hand |

```bash
cdkd deploy MyStack                       # exit 2 if either row is non-zero
cdkd deploy MyStack --allow-unaddressed   # exit 0 for the same run
```

The flag changes the **exit code**, and with it the run-level error message.
What survives it: the summary rows, each resource's own warning (naming its
cause and remedy), the switched banner, the `skipped` figure in `cdkd events`,
and the `RUN_FINISHED` `result: 'FAILED'` record. So a run that used the flag
still says — in its log and in its durable post-mortem — that a resource
survived. The events store records what happened, not what the operator chose
to tolerate.

What it DOES take away, beyond the exit code: the `PartialFailureError` message
is not raised at all, and that message is the only place the run-level
remediation text appears ("a skipped DELETE keeps its state record… a
replacement's survivor is not tracked — delete it by hand") along with the count
of stacks that were cancelled and never deployed. The banner's closing sentence
also differs. If you set the flag in CI, the per-resource warnings remain your
route to the cause.

It exists because the orphaned-predecessor case has a legitimate
not-yet-fixable window. The commonest instance is an ACM certificate
replacement rejected because a consumer — often a CloudFront distribution in
another stack not yet updated — still references the old certificate; the
delete succeeds on its own once `DescribeCertificate.InUseBy` is empty. Until
then a pipeline would be red for a cause it cannot act on.

Prefer the flag over wrapping the command in a shell exit-code test. `cdkd
deploy` also exits `2` for `MacroExpansionError` (a synth-time macro failure)
and `ResourceUpdateNotSupportedError`, so `cdkd deploy || [ $? -eq 2 ]` would
silence those unrelated real failures; `--allow-unaddressed` is scoped to this
one cause.

## `--no-cfn-fallback` (deploy / diff)

By default (issue
[#1697](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1697)), a cross-stack
reference that is not found in cdkd state falls back to CloudFormation,
so a cdkd-deployed consumer can reference a producer stack still managed
by CloudFormation (`cdk deploy` / raw CFn):

- `Fn::ImportValue` → CloudFormation `ListExports` in the consumer's
  region (CFn's own semantic for the intrinsic).
- `Fn::GetStackOutput` → CloudFormation `DescribeStacks` outputs in the
  target region. Same-account only — the `RoleArn` (cross-account) form
  never takes the fallback.

The fallback fires ONLY after a cdkd-state miss (cdkd-first precedence:
existing cdkd-to-cdkd references are untouched, and a name collision
resolves to the cdkd export). A CFn-sourced resolution is a **weak
reference** — not recorded into `state.imports` / `state.outputReads`,
so there is no destroy-time protection in either direction: deleting the
CFn producer breaks the consumer's next resolve, not the producer's
delete. A fallback lookup failure (e.g. missing
`cloudformation:ListExports` / `cloudformation:DescribeStacks`
permission) logs a warning and surfaces the original not-found error.

```bash
cdkd deploy MyStack --no-cfn-fallback   # cdkd-state-only resolution
cdkd diff MyStack --no-cfn-fallback     # preview with the same semantics
```

Pass the flag when you want cdkd-state-only semantics — IAM kept minimal,
or an export-name typo failing fast instead of accidentally matching an
unrelated CloudFormation export in the account. Nested-stack child
deploys inherit the flag from the parent deploy; `cdkd diff` honors it in
its best-effort resolvers so preview and apply resolve identically. See
[docs/cross-stack-references.md](cross-stack-references.md) for the full
design.

## CDK annotation messages (synth + deploy)

`cdkd synth` and `cdkd deploy` surface CDK `Annotations` messages with the
same semantics as the CDK CLI (issue #1228):

- `Annotations.of(scope).addError(...)` — the command prints every error as
  `[Error at /Construct/Path] message`, appends `Found errors`, and exits
  non-zero **without deploying anything**. `deploy` checks the final
  selection (including auto-included dependency stacks) before any AWS
  mutation, and an error annotation on a stack **outside** the selection
  does not block the deploy — matching `cdk deploy` semantics.
- `addWarning(...)` / `addInfo(...)` — printed as
  `[Warning at /path] ...` / `[Info at /path] ...`; the run proceeds.

Two flags adjust the failure threshold (issue #1230, CDK CLI parity —
both accepted by `synth` and `deploy`):

- `--strict` — additionally fail when any warning annotation exists
  (`Found warnings (--strict mode)`, non-zero exit). Info messages never
  fail. Errors still fail with `Found errors` (the error check wins when
  both exist).
- `--ignore-errors` — display every message but never fail the run
  ("Ignores synthesis errors, which will likely produce an invalid
  deployment" — same caveat as the CDK CLI flag). When combined with
  `--strict`, strict wins and warnings/errors fail again (CDK CLI
  precedence).

`cdkd synth` checks every synthesized stack (it has no stack selection).
Other synth-driven commands (`diff`, `list`, `import`, ...) do not fail on
error annotations, matching the upstream CLI. Both cloud-assembly metadata
layouts are supported: the inline `manifest.json` `metadata` field written
by older aws-cdk-lib versions and the `<artifactId>.metadata.json` side
file (`additionalMetadataFile`) written by current versions.

## `--region` / `AWS_REGION` (every command)

**A region is folded to its canonical lower-case spelling before it reaches an
AWS client.** `--region US-EAST-1`, `AWS_REGION=US-EAST-1` and
`AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=US-EAST-1` all behave exactly as `us-east-1` does.

One known exception, pinned by a test rather than left implicit:
`cdkd local start-api` folds the flag but not the env vars, so an upper-cased
`AWS_REGION` still reaches the Lambda containers it starts — issue
[#2103](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2103). Its three sibling
`cdkd local *` commands do fold both.

This is not cosmetic. Everything downstream of the value is case-SENSITIVE, and
in different ways:

| consumer | what a raw spelling does |
| --- | --- |
| SigV4 credential scope | `AuthorizationHeaderMalformed` (S3), `InvalidSignatureException` (Lambda / ECR), `SignatureDoesNotMatch` (STS) |
| SDK endpoint resolution | `CN-NORTH-1` resolves the **commercial** `amazonaws.com` instead of `amazonaws.com.cn` |
| ARN region segments | an ARN no IAM policy matches and every SDK call rejects |
| EC2 `region-name` filters | matches nothing, so `Fn::GetAZs` returns an EMPTY list |

Before issue [#2065](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2065) only the four
`cdkd local *` commands folded (issue
[#1795](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1795)), so `cdkd deploy --region
US-EAST-1` died at the state-bucket preflight before doing anything. DNS is
case-insensitive, which is why such a deploy got far enough to fail confusingly
rather than being rejected outright.

One value is deliberately NOT folded: the region `cdkd bootstrap` keys its
**marker** off, and with it the asset bucket / ECR repo names it creates. That
value stays verbatim because the marker READ that looks for an existing marker
is paired with the marker WRITE, and both must use the same spelling or a
recorded custom asset name stops being reused; aligning that pair is issue
[#1820](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1820)'s lane. The clients
`cdkd bootstrap` builds ARE folded.

The marker reads on the TEARDOWN and DEPLOY paths therefore try the canonical
key first and the spelling you passed second, so a marker written under a raw
key — by this cdkd or by an older one — is still found. `cdkd bootstrap`'s own
existing-marker read is the exception, and deliberately so: it reads the single
raw key it is about to write, because that read and that write are one pair. See the `cdkd gc` and `cdkd bootstrap --destroy` sections
above.

**Resolution order** is `--region` → `AWS_REGION` → `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` →
**the region your AWS profile resolves** → `us-east-1`.

`AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` is read even though the JS SDK itself does not (measured:
with only that variable set, the SDK resolves the *profile's* region instead).
The AWS CLI honours it, so reading it here is what stops cdkd disagreeing with
a CLI command you just ran.

The profile step is issue
[#2029](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2029), and it removes an
incoherence rather than adding a preference: cdkd ALREADY consulted your
profile, because every command builds its pre-flight AWS clients without a
region and lets the SDK resolve one. Only the region *value* — the one that
keys the bootstrap marker and answers `AWS::Region` — fell back to the literal.
One command, two regions.

**Currently this applies to the bootstrap-marker family** (`cdkd bootstrap`,
`cdkd gc`, `cdkd bootstrap --destroy`), which move together because one writes
the key the other two read. The commands whose region keys the *state file*
still use the `us-east-1` literal; moving them is issue
[#2100](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2100), and it needs its own
migration answer for the same reason.

### The reconciliation

Changing what a bare command targets could strand storage you already have, so
an **inferred** region yields to what exists:

| your profile | existing opt-in | cdkd uses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ap-northeast-1` | marker in `ap-northeast-1` | `ap-northeast-1` |
| `eu-west-1` | marker only in `us-east-1` | `us-east-1`, and says so |
| `eu-west-1` | none anywhere | `eu-west-1` (nothing to strand) |

A region you **name** is always obeyed as given — `--region X` means operate on
X, never "guess what I meant" — and `--region` is the escape hatch in both
directions. The hold prints:

```text
cdkd asset storage exists in us-east-1, but your AWS profile resolves eu-west-1.
Continuing to use us-east-1 so the existing storage is not orphaned. Pass
'--region eu-west-1' to target your profile's region, or '--region us-east-1'
to silence this message.
```

## `--role-arn`

Assume a different IAM role for cdkd's AWS API calls. Equivalent env
var: `CDKD_ROLE_ARN`. CLI flag takes precedence when both are set.

```bash
cdkd deploy --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/cdkd-deploy
# or
CDKD_ROLE_ARN=arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/cdkd-deploy cdkd deploy
```

cdkd does an `STS AssumeRole` once at command start (1-hour session,
session name `cdkd-<unix-ms>`) and writes the resulting temporary
credentials into `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` /
`AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` so every later AWS SDK client picks them up via
the standard default credentials chain. No re-plumbing of credential
arguments through cdkd's ~13 `AwsClients` instantiation sites is
required.

### Why the assumed role MUST have admin-equivalent permissions

Unlike `cdk deploy`, **cdkd does not route through CloudFormation**.
There is no cfn-exec-role to delegate to. Every IAM / EC2 / Lambda /
CloudFront / DynamoDB / etc. API call is issued from cdkd directly,
using whatever identity the SDK default chain resolves to (which, when
`--role-arn` is set, is the assumed role).

That means **CDK CLI's `cdk-hnb659fds-deploy-role-*` is NOT enough**:

| Role | Trust policy | Permissions | Works for cdkd? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cdk-hnb659fds-deploy-role-*` | IAM principals | CFn + asset-publish only (no raw EC2 / Lambda / IAM) | **No** — permission-denied during provisioning |
| `cdk-hnb659fds-cfn-exec-role-*` | `Service: cloudformation.amazonaws.com` | admin-equivalent | **No** — only assumable by CFn service, not by cdkd's IAM identity |
| Custom admin-equivalent role | IAM principals | admin-equivalent on the resources you deploy | **Yes** |

CDK CLI achieves "no local admin needed" through a two-step delegation
(IAM principal → deploy-role → CFn change set → cfn-exec-role's admin).
cdkd has no analogous chain — what you grant the assumed role is what
runs against AWS, end of story. The `--role-arn` flag exists so CI
runners with limited base credentials can still drive a cdkd deploy
against a separate-account or higher-privilege role; it does NOT
reduce the permissions the eventually-used identity needs.

### When the `--role-arn` session expires

Default session is 1 hour. For deploys that genuinely take longer
(rare; even `bench-cdk-sample` runs in ~3 min), the user re-runs the
cdkd command — in-flight credentials remain valid until expiry, but a
re-run is the simplest recovery path. cdkd does not currently auto-
refresh the session.

### `--profile` vs `--role-arn`

Independent. `--profile` selects which entry from `~/.aws/credentials`
or `~/.aws/config` provides the **base** credentials; `--role-arn`
then assumes a role from those base credentials. Use both together
when the IAM principal lives in profile A and the deploy role lives
in account B that profile A trusts.

## `cdkd bootstrap`

One-time per-account setup (plus once per additional region for asset
storage). Creates:

1. The S3 **state bucket** (`cdkd-state-{accountId}`, or `--state-bucket
   <name>`) — versioned, AES-256 encrypted, account-only bucket policy.
2. cdkd-owned **asset storage** for `--region` (issue
   [#1002](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1002)): the asset bucket
   (default name `cdkd-assets-{accountId}-{region}`; AES-256, account-only
   policy, no versioning — assets are immutable content-addressed blobs) and
   the container-asset ECR repo (default name
   `cdkd-container-assets-{accountId}-{region}`; immutable tags), plus the
   per-region bootstrap **marker**
   `s3://{stateBucket}/cdkd-bootstrap/{region}.json` that opts the region
   into cdkd-assets mode. Why: `cdk gc` decides "in use" by scanning
   CloudFormation stack templates — cdkd-deployed stacks have no CFn stack,
   so assets published to the CDK bootstrap bucket/repo look isolated to gc
   and get deleted. cdkd-owned storage is structurally out of gc's reach.
   See [docs/design/1002-cdkd-asset-storage.md](design/1002-cdkd-asset-storage.md).

Flags:

- `--no-assets` — skip step 2 (no asset bucket / ECR repo / marker).
  Explicit opt-out for users who keep CDK bootstrap storage or use a custom
  synthesizer with their own asset destinations. Deploys in the region stay
  in legacy mode (publish to the `assets.json` destinations verbatim).
- `--asset-bucket <name>` / `--container-repo <name>` (issue
  [#1011](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1011)) — custom names for
  the asset bucket / container-asset ECR repo instead of the defaults above.
  The escape hatch when the predictable default S3 name is squatted by
  another account (S3 names are global), and the compliance knob for
  org-wide naming policies (ECR repo names are account-scoped, so the ECR
  half is purely for naming policy). The names are validated before any AWS
  call (S3: 3-63 lowercase letters / digits / dots / hyphens, starting and
  ending with a letter or digit; ECR: 2-256 lowercase letters / digits with
  single `.` `_` `-` `/` separators), written into the bootstrap marker, and
  every consumer (deploy redirect / rewrite, publish, verification,
  `state info`, teardown) reads them from the marker from then on. A plain
  re-run of `cdkd bootstrap` keeps the marker's existing (custom) names.
  Re-bootstrapping a region with names that DIFFER from its marker is a hard
  error (`ASSET_STORAGE_NAME_CONFLICT`) — changing names would strand the
  existing storage and its published assets, so run
  `cdkd bootstrap --destroy --region <r>` first, then re-bootstrap with the
  new names. Rejected in combination with `--no-assets` (which skips the
  asset storage the flags name) and with `--destroy` (teardown reads the
  names from the marker). The deploy-time auto-create (issue #1007) always
  uses the default names — custom names require the explicit
  `cdkd bootstrap`. Custom bucket names get the same squatting defense as
  the defaults (owned-elsewhere hard refusal, `ExpectedBucketOwner` on every
  call).
- `--force` — reconfigure existing buckets/repo (re-apply encryption /
  policy / tag-immutability). Without it, existing resources are left
  untouched (re-running bootstrap is idempotent and is the supported way to
  opt an existing account's region into asset storage). Under `--destroy`,
  `--force` instead skips the deployed-stack reference scan (see below).
- `--state-bucket <name>` / `--region <region>` — as documented above;
  `--region` on bootstrap is a real (non-deprecated) option.
- `--destroy` — tear down the region's asset storage instead of creating it
  (see "Teardown" below).
- `--include-state-bucket` — with `--destroy` only: also delete the S3 state
  bucket.

Re-running `cdkd bootstrap` on an already-bootstrapped account does NOT
require `--force` to add the asset storage — the state bucket is simply
left as-is and the asset bucket / repo / marker are created. Accounts
bootstrapped by cdkd versions before 0.232.0 need no manual step at all:
the first `cdkd deploy` into each region auto-creates the storage (see
"Auto-create on first deploy" below); the explicit re-run is the
pre-provisioning alternative. Deploys that opt out stay in **legacy mode**
(publish to the CDK bootstrap destinations, byte-identical to older
versions, plus a one-line `cdk gc` notice naming the region) — nothing
breaks by upgrading the binary alone, and downgrading is safe in either
mode (old binaries ignore the marker; both storages hold the same
content-addressed objects).

Relationship with `cdk bootstrap`: cdkd never uses CDK's bootstrap roles
(it deploys with the caller's credentials) and does not resolve the
template's `BootstrapVersion` parameter, so a region never touched by
`cdk bootstrap` works fine. `cdkd export` hands a stack back to the
CloudFormation / CDK CLI world, where `cdk bootstrap` is the CDK CLI's own
prerequisite again.

Bucket-squatting defense: bootstrap refuses to adopt an asset bucket owned
by another account (predictable-name defense), and cdkd's asset-bucket S3
calls pass `ExpectedBucketOwner`. Deleting the asset bucket/repo while the
marker exists makes deploys fail with a re-bootstrap hint — cdkd never
silently falls back to CDK bootstrap storage once a region is opted in.

`cdkd state info` shows which regions are opted in (`Asset storage:` line /
`assetStorage` JSON field).

### Asset destinations after opt-in (cdkd-assets mode)

Once a region's bootstrap marker exists, every asset-consuming command
redirects **default-bootstrap-shaped** destinations
(`cdk-<qualifier>-assets-…` / `cdk-<qualifier>-container-assets-…` for this
account+region — exactly the population `cdk gc` can delete) to the
cdkd-owned storage, and rewrites the matching template references
(`Code.S3Bucket`, `Code.ImageUri`, `s3.Asset` URLs in env vars, nested-stack
`TemplateURL`, …) to the cdkd names. `objectKey` / `imageTag` (content
hashes) are unchanged. User-chosen storage (custom `fileAssetsBucketName` /
`imageAssetsRepositoryName`, `AppStagingSynthesizer` staging buckets) and
cross-region destinations are never touched — `cdk gc` cannot reach those.

Per-command behavior:

| Command | cdkd-assets mode |
| --- | --- |
| `deploy` | redirect publishes + rewrite templates (incl. nested children); a post-resolution audit fails any resource whose resolved properties still name the CDK bootstrap storage |
| `diff` (incl. `--recursive`) | rewrite, so the shown plan matches what deploy will do (incl. the one-time migration diff) |
| `import` | rewrite the template, but record the **pre-rewrite** values in state so the first post-import `cdkd deploy` repoints the live resources (issue [#1652](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1652)) |
| `publish-assets` | redirect via the same table (reads the marker from the state bucket; falls back to legacy with an info line when no state bucket resolves) |
| `synth` / `export` | **unrewritten** — synth prints the CDK app's template; export returns the stack to the CFn/cdk-assets world |
| `destroy` / `state *` / `drift` / `events` | state-driven, unchanged |

The first deploy after opting in shows a one-time "everything with assets
updates" diff — an ordinary in-place UPDATE repointing `Code` / `Image` at
cdkd storage (content identical, no replacement). The first deploy after a
`cdkd import` shows the same diff, for the same reason: state deliberately
records the pre-rewrite references, so that deploy is what actually repoints
the imported resources.

`--use-cdk-bootstrap-assets` (on `deploy` / `diff` / `import` /
`publish-assets`) pins legacy destinations for one invocation even after the
region is opted in; `cdk.json` `context.cdkd.useCdkBootstrapAssets: true`
pins it per app — for apps deployed via both CloudFormation and cdkd during
a migration window. The pin also suppresses the legacy-mode `cdk gc` notice.

### Auto-create on first deploy (issue #1007)

`cdkd deploy` into a region that has **no** bootstrap marker auto-creates
the per-region asset storage (asset bucket + container-asset ECR repo +
marker — the same `ensureAssetStorage` path `cdkd bootstrap` uses, including
the squatting defense and marker-written-last ordering) instead of falling
back to legacy mode, so `cdkd bootstrap` stays a true once-per-account step.

- Interactive runs are prompted once per region (`[Y/n]`, default yes);
  `--yes` / non-TTY runs create immediately with an info line.
- A declined prompt or a failed creation (e.g. S3/ECR create denied) falls
  back to legacy mode with an actionable warning — a deploy that worked
  before never starts hard-failing.
- Opt out per invocation with `--no-auto-asset-storage`, or per app with
  `cdk.json` `context.cdkd.autoAssetStorage: false`. The
  `--use-cdk-bootstrap-assets` pin also disables it (the marker is never
  read), as does `--dry-run` (a dry run creates nothing). Only `deploy`
  auto-creates — `diff` / `import` / `publish-assets` never create
  resources.

### Teardown (`cdkd bootstrap --destroy`, issue #1010)

`cdkd bootstrap --destroy --region <r>` is the reverse of bootstrap for ONE
region's asset storage — the cdkd equivalent of deleting the CDK CLI's
`CDKToolkit` stack, replacing the manual `aws s3 rb` / `aws ecr
delete-repository` / marker-delete sequence. It:

1. Empties (all versions + delete markers) and deletes the region's **asset
   bucket**, then force-deletes the **container-asset ECR repo**, then
   deletes the region's bootstrap **marker LAST** — the mirror of the
   create side's marker-written-last ordering, so a crash mid-teardown
   leaves the region consistently opted in (deploys hard-error with a
   re-bootstrap hint rather than silently falling back to legacy mode).
2. Reads the asset bucket / repo **names from the marker**, never from the
   naming convention — compatible with custom asset-storage names. A region
   named by `--region` OR by `AWS_REGION` is lower-cased before it reaches any
   AWS client or the marker key, and both spellings of the key are probed, as
   in `cdkd gc` (issue
   [#1995](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1995)) — with a sharper
   consequence here: an unmatched marker made this command report "nothing to
   delete" and exit 0 while the bucket and repo stayed alive. The marker
   deleted in step 1 is the key the marker was actually READ from, so the
   teardown cannot delete the wrong one. A region bootstrapped under MORE than
   one spelling of its name has more than one marker, and the teardown deletes
   exactly one of them: each survivor is reported with a warning naming its own
   key and the `--region` spelling that reaches it (only that spelling does —
   the canonical key is gone by then). Their asset storage is left standing on
   purpose, since two markers can name two different sets of custom names and
   the marker is the only record of them. The same listing runs when NO marker
   is found under either probed spelling, so a region whose only marker carries
   a third spelling is reported rather than dismissed with "nothing to delete";
   in that case the "re-run `cdkd bootstrap`" hint is withheld, because
   re-bootstrapping would write a second marker with DEFAULT names and the next
   teardown would destroy that storage while the existing marker's survives.
   The listing needs `s3:ListBucket` on the state bucket, which a plain
   `--destroy` did not previously require: without it the teardown still
   proceeds and warns that the check could not be made, while
   `--include-state-bucket` refuses outright
   (`STATE_BUCKET_MARKER_SCAN_FAILED`), since there the listing is the only
   thing preventing sibling markers from being deleted with the bucket.
3. Refuses while any deployed stack's state still references the region's
   asset bucket / repo (running Lambdas keep working after deletion, but a
   future re-deploy / rollback of those stacks would break). The scan
   covers every state file in the bucket regardless of the
   `--state-prefix` it was deployed under. `--force` overrides the scan.
4. Prompts for confirmation with the full deletion plan (`y/N`, default
   No); `--yes` / `-y` skips the prompt. A non-TTY stdin without `--yes` is
   a hard error.
5. Is idempotent: already-missing pieces are skipped with info lines
   (mirror of `ensureAssetStorage`), and every S3 call passes
   `ExpectedBucketOwner` (a foreign bucket squatting the name is refused,
   never deleted).

The **state bucket is kept by default** — it is the account's source of
truth. `--include-state-bucket` opts it into the teardown, and even then
the deletion is refused while ANY stack state exists — under any
`--state-prefix`, the guard lists the whole bucket — (destroy every stack
first; there is no `--force` override) or while any OTHER region still has
a bootstrap marker in the bucket (tear those regions down first — deleting
their markers with the bucket would silently flip them back to legacy
mode). "Other" is decided case-insensitively, so a region whose marker was
written under a different spelling of its own name is not mistaken for a
second region — but the refusal NAMES each one by the spelling its marker
key actually uses, because that is the spelling
`cdkd bootstrap --destroy --region <r>` needs in order to find it (issue
[#1995](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1995)). The same refusal covers
a marker for THIS region under another spelling: the teardown deletes one
marker key, so deleting the state bucket while a sibling is still in it would
remove that record while the asset storage it names survives, nameless.

A region with no bootstrap marker is a no-op (nothing to delete); note the
auto-create-on-first-deploy behavior above will re-create the storage on
the next `cdkd deploy` into the region unless you opt out
(`--no-auto-asset-storage` / `context.cdkd.autoAssetStorage: false`).

## `cdkd gc` (garbage-collect cdkd-owned asset storage)

`cdkd gc [--region <r>] [--older-than <dur>] [--dry-run] [-y]` deletes
unreferenced objects / images from ONE region's cdkd-owned asset storage
(the asset bucket + container-asset ECR repo created by `cdkd bootstrap`,
issue #1012). Assets are content-addressed and deliberately never deleted
on `cdkd destroy` (another stack or a future rollback may reference the
same hash), so the storage grows without bound — and `cdk gc` cannot reach
it by design. cdkd can gc it *precisely* because its state files record
exactly which assets are in use.

**Scope**: one region per invocation, resolved as `--region` → `AWS_REGION` →
`AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` → your AWS profile's region → `us-east-1`, with the
reconciliation described under
[`--region` / `AWS_REGION`](#--region--aws_region-every-command) — so a bare
`cdkd gc` collects in the region you actually work in, not in `us-east-1`
(issue [#2029](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2029)). The region gc
reports, the region its clients target and the region its marker key is built
from are **one value by construction** (issue
[#2029](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2029) — they used to be resolved
separately and could disagree, so gc read one region's marker and deleted
against another region's endpoints), and the delete plan now names it
explicitly, because with a custom `--asset-bucket` name the plan would
otherwise mention no region at all.

`cdkd bootstrap` WRITES the marker through the same resolver and the same
reconciliation, so the read and write sides cannot drift apart — which is why
this could not be done for gc alone (issue
[#1820](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1820)). The resolved region is
lower-cased before it reaches any AWS client or the marker key, and the marker
is looked up under the canonical spelling first and the spelling you passed
second, so `--region US-EAST-1` finds the marker either way (issue
[#1995](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1995)); the second probe exists
because `cdkd bootstrap` still keys the marker off its region verbatim. The
asset bucket / repo names are read from the region's bootstrap marker, never
recomputed from the naming convention (custom-name compatible). A region with
no marker is a friendly no-op. **CDK bootstrap storage (`cdk-hnb659fds-*`) is never
touched** — that stays `cdk gc`'s job.

**Reference collection**: every state file in the state bucket is scanned
(the whole bucket, so stacks deployed under any `--state-prefix` are
covered — including nested-stack children). References are collected from
each resource's `properties` / `observedProperties` / `attributes` and the
stack `outputs`, matching `{S3Bucket, S3Key}` pairs (Lambda `Code` etc.),
`s3://` URIs, virtual-hosted and path-style `https://...<urlSuffix>`
URLs (query strings stripped), and ECR image URIs by `:tag` and/or
`@sha256:digest`. `<urlSuffix>` matches EVERY partition's suffix
(`amazonaws.com` / `amazonaws.com.cn` / `c2s.ic.gov` / `sc2s.sgov.gov` /
`cloud.adc-e.uk` / `csp.hci.ic.gov` / `amazonaws.eu`), not just the one
the gc region uses — the scan reads state written by any cdkd binary for
any region, and a suffix the matchers miss reads as UNREFERENCED and is
DELETED (issue
[#1781](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1781)). ECR hosts
additionally match the FIPS (`<acct>.dkr.ecr-fips.<region>.<urlSuffix>`)
and dual-stack (`<acct>.dkr-ecr.<region>.on.aws`,
`<acct>.dkr-ecr-fips.<region>.on.aws`) endpoints — that list now comes from
the single ECR host FORM TABLE in `src/utils/ecr-uri.ts` rather than a second
copy here, which is what surfaced the dual-stack FIPS form gc had been
missing (issue [#1793](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1793)). ECR
hosts are matched case-INSENSITIVELY, since DNS is (issue
[#1792](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1792)) — and a matched
`@sha256:` DIGEST is normalized to lower case as it is collected, which the
case-insensitive match alone does NOT give you: a collected digest is compared
for EXACT equality against ECR's always-lower-case `imageDigest`, so an
upper-cased reference would be collected yet unmatchable and the live image
would still be deleted. The `:tag` is deliberately kept verbatim, because ECR
tags ARE case-sensitive.

The three S3 shapes are matched case-insensitively across the HOST too, for the
same DNS reason (issue
[#1847](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1847)): the `s3://` / `https`
scheme, the `s3` label, the region and the `<urlSuffix>` all fold. The BUCKET
name folds only where it is a DNS label — the virtual-hosted
`https://<bucket>.s3.<region>.<urlSuffix>/<key>` shape, where an upper-cased
spelling reaches the same live object. It stays EXACT in path style (a PATH
segment) and in an `s3://` URI (the AUTHORITY), which S3 compares byte for byte
and where a case-variant therefore names a different bucket. The object KEY is
kept verbatim in every shape, since S3 keys ARE case-sensitive — the same
collected-yet-unmatchable trap the ECR digest note above describes, in reverse.

**Guards** (this command deletes data — every ambiguity is biased toward
NOT deleting):

- **Fail safe**: a state file that fails to JSON-parse aborts the whole
  run — deleting on partial knowledge is how a live asset gets deleted.
- **Lock guard**: any stack lock (`lock.json`) in the state bucket aborts
  with a listing of the locked stack(s) — a deploy in flight may have
  published assets whose state write has not landed yet.
- **Age guard**: `--older-than <dur>` (default `30d`, accepts `<n>d` /
  `<n>h`) — an object (`LastModified`) / image (`imagePushedAt`) newer
  than the cutoff is never deleted, even when unreferenced. Protects
  in-flight publishes and recent rollback targets. Missing timestamps are
  treated as "new" (kept).
- **Ownership**: every S3 call pins `ExpectedBucketOwner`; a 403 on the
  asset bucket is a foreign-bucket refusal (never deleted).

**Reporting + confirmation**: the reclaim plan (per-item key / tag+digest,
size, age) and byte totals are printed first. `--dry-run` prints the plan
and exits without prompting or deleting. Otherwise an interactive
`Continue? (y/N)` prompt (default No) gates the deletion; `--yes` / `-y`
skips it, and a non-TTY stdin without `--yes` is a hard error. Zero
candidates → info line, exit 0, no prompt. Deletion is chunked
(`DeleteObjects` 1,000 keys / `BatchDeleteImage` 100 images per call) and
any per-item failure is surfaced as a hard error.

Also accepts `--state-bucket`, `--profile`, `--role-arn`, `--verbose`.

**Reference shapes covered**: `{S3Bucket, S3Key}` / `{Bucket, Key}` (and any
other object shape carrying the asset bucket name as a value — every sibling
string is protected), `s3://` URIs, virtual-hosted and path-style `https`
URLs, ECR image URIs by tag and/or digest, content-addressed
`<sha256>.<ext>` tokens anywhere in a state string (protects keys embedded
in joined lists), and references inside base64-encoded values (one decode
level — covers `Fn::Base64`-resolved EC2 / ASG UserData fetching assets at
boot).

**Known limitation**: an UNTAGGED child manifest of a referenced multi-arch
/ attestation image index is not individually protected (references point at
the index). cdkd's own image publisher builds single-manifest images
(`BUILDX_NO_DEFAULT_ATTESTATIONS=1`), so this only affects images
hand-pushed into the cdkd repo — keep those out of gc'd repos or reference
them by digest in a deployed stack.

## `cdkd diff`

`cdkd diff [<stacks...>]` synthesizes the CDK app and reports the
per-resource CREATE / UPDATE / DELETE changes the next `cdkd deploy`
would apply, comparing the synth template against cdkd's S3 state.

- `--recursive` (issue [#555](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/555)
  A5) — recurse into every `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack` row and diff each
  nested-stack child against its **own** deployed state
  (`cdkd/<parent>~<childLogicalId>/<region>/state.json`), in DFS order.
  Default is non-recursive, matching `cdk diff` (which shows the parent's
  nested-stack row as a single `TemplateURL` / `Parameters` change with no
  descent). Each child's block is printed under a `Nested stack: <name>`
  header (the full `~`-joined state name, matching `cdkd state show
  --show-nested`). The walk previews the full next deploy: a nested child
  with no state file yet diffs as all-CREATE; a nested stack removed from
  the CDK code (present in state, absent from the template) diffs as
  all-DELETE recursively.
- `--fail` — exit `1` when any change is detected (parity with `cdk diff
  --fail`). With `--recursive`, considers the whole nested-stack tree, so
  CI can gate on tree-wide drift with a single `cdkd diff <parent>
  --recursive --fail`. Without `--fail`, `cdkd diff` always exits `0` even
  when changes are present (parity with `cdk diff`'s default).
- `--json` — emit the diff as JSON instead of human-readable text. A flat
  array of `{stack, region, changes: [...], outputChanges: [...], children:
  [...]}` records (one per target stack); with `--recursive`, `children` is
  populated with the same nested shape recursively. `NO_CHANGE` resources are
  omitted; `children` and `outputChanges` are always present (empty on leaves /
  when the Outputs section is unchanged) so the key set is stable.
  Each change entry additionally carries `ccApi?: string[]` when the
  resource would auto-route via Cloud Control API on the next deploy (the
  human renderer's `[via CC API: <props>]` annotation in machine form;
  absent when the resource routes via its SDK provider). Each
  `outputChanges` entry is `{name, changeType: "ADD" | "MODIFY" | "REMOVE",
  oldValue?, newValue?, oldValueRedacted?, export}` — `oldValue` is absent on an
  `ADD` and `newValue` on a `REMOVE`, and `oldValue` is also withheld (with
  `oldValueRedacted: true` in its place) when state holds legacy secret
  plaintext for that key. Progress logging is suppressed so stdout carries
  only the JSON payload.

**Outputs section** (issue
[#1921](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1921)): the diff also compares
the template's `Outputs` against the outputs bag in state, so an
**Outputs-only** change — one whose `Resources` section is byte-identical — is
reported instead of printing `No changes detected`, and `--fail` exits `1` for
it. This is the preview half of the Outputs-only persist `cdkd deploy` gained
in [#875](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/875): when a downstream stack
starts referencing a producer, CDK synth adds an `Output` with an `Export.Name`
to the producer while leaving its resources untouched, and without this the
preview steered the user away from the deploy that publishes the export.
Removals are reported too — dropping an export can break a consumer's
`Fn::ImportValue`.

```text
Outputs:
  [+] ExportsOutputFnGetAttBucketArn
        new: "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket"
  [+] ProducerStack:ExportsOutputFnGetAttBucketArn [export]
        new: "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket"

0 to create, 0 to update, 0 to delete
2 output(s) to add, 0 to change, 0 to remove
```

Rows are keyed by what actually lands in state, so an output carrying an
`Export.Name` shows **two** rows — its logical name and its export name. The
`[export]` row is the string a consumer's `Fn::ImportValue` resolves against.
The Outputs counts are a **separate** summary line: an Outputs change is a
state / exports-index write with no AWS resource operation behind it, so it
never inflates the create / update / delete counts. Output values are resolved
best-effort against current state, exactly as `cdkd deploy` resolves them; when
an output cannot be fully resolved (typically because it references a resource
this deploy has yet to create) the Outputs section is omitted rather than
guessed — that resource's `CREATE` is already on the resource side of the diff
— and a warning says so, so an absent section never silently means "unchanged".

Because this is the only command that prints a **stored** output value, two
safeguards apply. A previous value that is legacy secret plaintext is withheld from
both the text and `--json` output rather than printed into CI logs. Two signals
identify such a record: the template side still being a `{{resolve:...}}`
expression while state is not (exactly what [`cdkd scrub`](#cdkd-scrub-state-secret-hygiene-clean--audit) repairs),
and the template declaring the output's value as a dynamic reference — the latter
also covers an output that was condition-skipped, which has no template side left
to compare. Because a record with any such key was written by a pre-redaction
binary, both of those withhold **record-wide**: every previous value in that
record is withheld, and the change itself is still reported.
A third, **per-key** refusal covers an output DELETED from the template: a stored
key today's template cannot account for (no declared output name, no literal
`Export.Name`, not in the resolved bag) has its value withheld — only when the
template still proves a secret reference anywhere, and not when any stored value
is itself a secret expression (which shows the last write already redacted the
whole bag). Deleting an output is an ordinary refactor, so those two gates are
what keep the refusal off stacks that handle no secrets at all. For a nested
child REMOVED from its parent's template there is no template left to account for
anything, so the refusal applies to that child's whole stored bag whenever the
parent's template proves a secret reference. That population is now REPAIRABLE by
[`cdkd scrub`](#cdkd-scrub-state-secret-hygiene-clean--audit) (issue
[#2005](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2005)); the refusal here is
unchanged, because `diff` still cannot decide from a stored string alone whether
a value is a plaintext. Second, output / export names and
rendered values are stripped of control and bidi characters before display: an
`Export.Name` is a value cdkd resolved (from an `Fn::Sub`, a parameter, an SSM
lookup), so unlike a CloudFormation logical ID it never passed a validator. The
`--json` payload is deliberately left byte-faithful — it is a machine interface,
and mutating a name a consumer matches on would be worse than the display concern
it would avoid.

Resolving `Outputs` is new work for `cdkd diff`: an output using
`Fn::ImportValue` / `Fn::GetStackOutput` may now cost a `ListExports` /
`DescribeStacks` call (subject to `--no-cfn-fallback`), an `Fn::GetAZs` output an
EC2 `DescribeAvailabilityZones`, a `{{resolve:ssm:...}}` output one
`GetParameter` issued with `WithDecryption: false`, and an `Fn::GetStackOutput`
carrying a `RoleArn` a cross-account `sts:AssumeRole` (the `RoleArn` must be a
template literal, so it is not attacker-selectable).

**Routing annotation**: every CREATE / UPDATE line whose template uses a
top-level CFn property cdkd's SDK provider does not yet wire is tagged
`[via CC API: <prop list>]` so the routing decision is auditable at plan
time — the same auto-fallback the deploy engine applies (#614). DELETE
lines are not annotated; deletes route via the recorded `provisionedBy`
on each resource's state, not via template inspection.

Like every non-bootstrap command, `--region` is deprecated (prefer
`AWS_REGION` / your AWS profile) but still honored if passed.
Stack selection (`<stacks...>` / `--all` / wildcards / display paths)
follows the same rules as `cdkd deploy` / `cdkd destroy`.

## `cdkd drift`

`cdkd drift [<stack>...]` detects drift between cdkd's S3 state
and the live AWS-side configuration of each managed resource. cdkd does
not go through CloudFormation, so CFn-style drift detection does not
apply — instead, the command asks each resource's provider for its
`readCurrentState` snapshot and compares it against the **deploy-time
AWS snapshot** stored in `ResourceState.observedProperties` (state
schema `version: 3`+). Resources written by an older binary or by a
provider without `readCurrentState` lack `observedProperties` — for
those, the comparator falls back to the user-templated `properties`
field (the pre-v3 behavior). The observed-baseline path is what makes
console-side changes to keys the user did not template surface as
drift; the fallback only catches changes to keys the user did template.
One carve-out on the observed-baseline path: a top-level key the
template never declared whose captured value was EMPTY (`[]` / `{}` /
`null`) is skipped entirely. Such keys are typically materialized AFTER
the capture by a sibling resource in the same stack
(`AWS::ECS::ClusterCapacityProviderAssociations` populating the
cluster's `CapacityProviders`, a standalone
`AWS::AutoScaling::LifecycleHook` populating the ASG's hook list,
standalone security-group ingress/egress rules) or by AWS itself, so
comparing them reported permanent phantom drift on a freshly deployed
stack — and `--revert` then stripped that sibling-managed configuration
from AWS (issue #1498). CloudFormation's drift detection only compares
template-declared properties, so this matches its behavior for that
class; an undeclared key captured with a real value (an AWS-side
default) is still compared.
See [docs/state-management.md](state-management.md) for the schema
details.

Detection is the default behavior — pass `--accept` or `--revert` to
also resolve any drift the comparator finds (see "Resolving drift" below).

```bash
# Single stack — auto-selects when state has exactly one stack
cdkd drift

# Single stack by name
cdkd drift MyStack

# Every stack in the bucket
cdkd drift --all

# Disambiguate when the same stack name has state in multiple regions
cdkd drift MyStack --stack-region us-east-1

# Machine-readable output for CI gating
cdkd drift --all --json

# Resolve drift: state ← AWS (catch up cdkd state with manual console changes)
cdkd drift MyStack --accept --yes

# Resolve drift: AWS ← state (push cdkd state values back into AWS)
cdkd drift MyStack --revert --yes

# Preview either resolution without acquiring a lock or hitting AWS
cdkd drift MyStack --accept --dry-run
cdkd drift MyStack --revert --dry-run
```

Flags:

- `<stacks...>` — zero or more positional stack names (physical
  CloudFormation names). When omitted and `--all` is not set, the
  command auto-selects the single stack in state (mirrors `cdkd deploy`
  / `cdkd destroy`); fails with a listing if state has more than one
  stack.
- `--all` — drift-check every stack in the state bucket.
- `--stack-region <region>` — region to inspect when a stackName has
  state in multiple regions (mirrors `cdkd state show`).
- `--json` — emit a structured per-stack report (see below). Detection
  output only — the resolution paths print a plain-text plan + summary.
- `--accept` — write the AWS-current values back into cdkd state (state
  ← AWS) for every drifted property. By default this updates
  `observedProperties` (the deploy-time snapshot used as the drift
  baseline) so the next drift run reports clean, while leaving
  `properties` (the user's last-deployed template intent) untouched. For
  resources without `observedProperties` (older state, providers without
  `readCurrentState`) the mutation falls back to `properties`, matching
  the pre-v3 behavior. Requires a stack lock. Mutually exclusive with
  `--revert`. See "Resolving drift" below.
- `--revert` — call `provider.update` to push cdkd state values back
  into AWS (AWS ← state) for every drifted resource. The values passed
  to `provider.update` are constructed as the AWS-current snapshot with
  the drifted top-level subtrees overlaid from
  `observedProperties ?? properties` — same precedence as the
  comparator, so `--revert` undoes exactly the delta `cdkd drift`
  reported and leaves non-drifted attributes untouched. One exception:
  a drifted **top-level tag list** keeps any AWS-SERVICE-authored entry
  instead of stripping it (issue #1501). Every ordinary tag still
  reverts exactly as before — one the baseline lost is re-added, a
  changed value is reset, and a user- or console-added tag AWS alone
  carries is still REMOVED — but a service-managed key
  (`AmazonECSManaged`, or any `aws:`-reserved prefix) survives. ECS
  attaches `AmazonECSManaged` to an ASG when a capacity provider binds
  it and managed scaling breaks without it, so the previous
  strip-everything revert silently broke live resources. The `--revert`
  plan names each preserved key before the confirmation prompt. The
  carve-out applies to a top-level property NAMED `Tags` (or ending in
  `Tags`) — the `[{Key, Value}]` shape alone is not tag-exclusive, e.g.
  `LoadBalancerAttributes` — and it applies even when the recorded
  baseline list is EMPTY, since a declared-but-empty `Tags` still has an
  AWS side worth diffing. A tag list NESTED inside another property (an
  EC2 launch template's `TagSpecifications`) still reverts wholesale.

  The plan also **names the AWS-authored values the revert leaves alone**
  (issue [#1478](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1478), semantics
  settled by [#1626](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1626)). A revert
  overwrites each drifted top-level subtree from
  `observedProperties ?? properties`, so when a resource has NO
  `observedProperties` (older state, or a deploy-time capture that failed)
  the desired side is the raw template — and anything AWS wrote into that
  subtree but the template never declared is indistinguishable from an
  out-of-band change. cdkd preserves those paths and lists them before the
  confirmation prompt. Both shapes are covered: nested object
  keys report dotted (`Parameters.table_type`), and a KEYED
  `[{Key, Value}]` list reports its missing entries in bracket form
  (`LoadBalancerAttributes[deletion_protection.enabled]`) — the bracket
  distinguishes a list entry from a nested path, since attribute keys contain
  dots of their own. That keyed-list half was added by issue
  [#1626](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1626): the walk previously
  skipped every array, which is exactly the shape with the most at stake, so
  a revert against an ELBv2 resource could touch ~18 untemplated attributes
  while the plan named none. A service-authored tag is NOT listed — the
  carve-out above preserves it either way. A POSITIONAL array is still
  compared wholesale, because its elements have positions rather than
  identities, so it is neither reported nor narrowed.

  `--revert` normally leaves cdkd state alone — once the update succeeds,
  AWS matches state by definition. The ONE exception (issue
  [#1644](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1644)) is a provider that
  reports a **narrowing**: some providers answer `update()` with the bag
  they ACTUALLY sent, because AWS only accepts a narrower form than the
  template declares (`AWS::EC2::Route`'s single destination, an
  `AWS::EC2::SecurityGroupIngress` `IpProtocol` coerced to a string). The
  deploy path already records that narrowed value; `--revert` now does the
  same, writing ONLY the keys the provider changed into the same field the
  comparator uses as its baseline (`observedProperties` when the resource
  has one, else `properties`). Without it the next `cdkd drift` reported
  the identical difference and `--revert` re-issued the identical call,
  forever. Only the provider-changed keys move — the AWS-current values
  that rode along in the bag sent to `provider.update` are NOT imported
  into state, so `--revert` never behaves like `--accept`. Two further limits
  keep that guarantee airtight: only a key the baseline ALREADY declares can
  move (a provider echoing back an out-of-band, AWS-only key cannot insert it),
  and on a resource with no `observedProperties` only a key REMOVAL is recorded,
  never a value — that baseline is the raw template, the values sent to the
  provider deliberately carry the untemplated AWS paths described above, and
  writing one into `properties` would make the template intent describe AWS-side
  data. That write is BEST-EFFORT: AWS has already been reverted by the time it
  runs, so a failed state write warns and the command carries on (under `--all`,
  aborting would skip every later stack's revert). The only cost of the warn
  path is that the narrowing re-surfaces on the next `cdkd drift`.

  Requires a stack lock. Mutually exclusive with
  `--accept`. See "Resolving drift" below.
- `--dry-run` — for `--accept` / `--revert`: print the planned mutations
  and exit without acquiring a lock or hitting AWS / S3.
- `--concurrency <number>` — maximum concurrent `provider.update` calls
  during `--revert` (default `4`). No effect on `--accept` (writes are
  serialized per stack).
- `-y` / `--yes` — skip the confirmation prompt before writing state
  (`--accept`) or pushing changes back to AWS (`--revert`).
- `--state-bucket`, `--state-prefix`, `--profile`, `--verbose`,
  `--role-arn`, `--region` — same as on every other state-driven
  command. `--region` is deprecated (prefer `AWS_REGION` / your AWS
  profile) but still honored if passed (PR 5).

Exit codes:

| Exit | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Every inspected stack has zero drift **and cdkd refused no comparison**, OR `--accept` / `--revert` resolved every drift cleanly. Note a resource can be reported under `notCompared` and the run still exit `0` — that happens when the only reason it was not compared is a `{{resolve:...}}` spelling cdkd never resolves (see the `2 (detection)` row). `--accept` also exits `0` when it deliberately REFUSED a secret-bearing property whose AWS-current value it could not identify (see "Secret dynamic references" above) — the refusal is warned about by name and the drift is still reported on the next run. |
| `1` | Drift detected on at least one resource on at least one stack (detection-only mode), OR the command crashed (no state found, AWS error, bad arguments). Both go through the default error handler — drift detection emits the rich human report before throwing, so the report is the only output for the drift case. Drift OUTRANKS a partial comparison: a run that both detects drift and leaves something uncompared exits `1`, not `2`. |
| `2` (detection) | Nothing drifted, but cdkd **deliberately REFUSED** to compare at least one resource: a dynamic reference its state records could not be attributed to a region, so its secret-bearing properties were not compared (issue [#2108](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2108)). Reporting that run as `0` would be a clean bill of health for a comparison that did not happen — and before #2108 the same population exited `1`, because cdkd resolved the reference in the wrong region and reported phantom drift, so a non-zero exit is what CI consumers already had. **This is narrower than `notCompared`, deliberately.** A resource whose only uncompared properties hold a surviving `{{resolve:ssm-secure:...}}` token is listed under `notCompared` and in the `PARTIALLY compared` block, but does **not** produce this exit code: cdkd has never resolved that spelling, so the condition is permanent and unclearable by any action you can take, and exiting non-zero for it would fail such a stack's CI forever over something unrelated. Fix the refusal by spelling the reference as a full ARN, which names its region. |
| `2` (`--revert`) | `--revert` finished but one or more resources did not revert (`PartialFailureError`): a `provider.update` call failed, threw `ResourceUpdateNotSupportedError`, or — counted and reported separately, since it never reached `provider.update` at all — cdkd could not re-resolve the dynamic reference(s) the resource's state records (grant the caller `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` / `ssm:GetParameter`, or fix the reference). Successful resources are now in sync; re-run `cdkd drift <stack>` to see what's left, then either `cdkd drift <stack> --revert` (for the recoverable failures) or `cdkd deploy <stack> --replace` (for the update-not-supported ones). |

The command produces four terminal states per resource:

- **drifted** — at least one property differs between state and AWS.
  Reported as `~ <logicalId> (<type>)` with one `+/-` line per
  property path that diverged.
- **clean** — every state-recorded property was compared against AWS and
  matched. Counted in the per-stack summary but not listed individually.
- **not compared** — nothing differed, but cdkd did not compare every
  property: it could not, or refused to, resolve a dynamic reference the
  resource's state records, so its secret-bearing properties were never
  looked at.
- **drift unknown** — the provider does not implement the optional
  `readCurrentState` method yet. Reported as `? <logicalId> (<type>)`
  in a separate block at the bottom of each stack's report, and — like
  everything else nothing was read for — **excluded from the summary's
  "checked" count**, which reports it separately as `N unsupported`
  (issue [#2141](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2141)). A stack whose
  only resource is unsupported prints
  `no drift detected (0 resources checked, 1 unsupported)`.

A **drifted** resource can be partially compared too — the changes it reports
are real, but they are not the whole comparison — so it carries
`referencesUnresolved: true` alongside them. Everything partially compared, that
resource included, is rolled up under `notCompared` in `--json`, listed under a
`PARTIALLY compared` block in the human report, and excluded from that report's
"fully checked" count — as is anything **unsupported**, so both the `N checked`
and the `N of M fully checked` spellings count only resources a comparison was
attempted for. In the `N of M` spelling the unsupported total is reported
outside the parenthetical (`1 of 3 resources fully checked (2 only partially
compared), 1 unsupported`), so the bracketed figure accounts for exactly the
gap between the two numbers rather than reading as a third share of `M`. A **clean** verdict never means anything but "compared
and matched" (issue [#2135](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2135)).

Two different things land in that bucket, and only one of them changes the exit
code:

- **Refused** — cdkd CAN read the reference but declines to, because it cannot
  tell which region should answer for it. This is actionable (spell the
  reference as a full ARN) and it drives exit `2`.
- **Unresolvable** — a `{{resolve:...}}` spelling cdkd resolves for nobody, in
  practice `{{resolve:ssm-secure:...}}`, which CloudFormation resolves
  server-side. Nothing you can do makes cdkd compare it, so it is reported but
  left out of the exit code.

The `--json` payload does not distinguish them today; if you need to, key on
whether the run exited `2`. Issue
[#2135](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2135) tracks giving the two
causes a single, explicit representation.

**Secret dynamic references** (`{{resolve:secretsmanager:...}}`, and
`{{resolve:ssm:...}}` naming a `SecureString` parameter) are compared
like-for-like. cdkd state stores the unresolved expression, never the
plaintext, so `cdkd drift` re-resolves the baseline in memory before
comparing it against the AWS-current snapshot — a comparison, and nothing
else: the resolved value is never written to state (issue
[#1914](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1914)).

This means `cdkd drift` needs **read access to the referenced secrets**:
`secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` for a `secretsmanager` reference, and
`ssm:GetParameter` (with `kms:Decrypt` on the parameter's key) for an `ssm`
one. Earlier versions made no such call. If the caller lacks the permission,
or the secret has been deleted, cdkd **warns and continues**: that one
resource's secret-bearing properties are reported as neither clean nor
drifted — they are simply not compared — and every other resource and stack
in the run is unaffected.

What the report is allowed to show at a secret-bearing property is
deliberately narrow:

- When AWS holds the value the reference resolves to, both sides render as
  the `{{resolve:...}}` expression, so the property is clean and nothing is
  printed at all.
- When AWS holds anything else — the commonest cause is a **Secrets Manager
  rotation**, where the deployed resource still carries the previous version,
  but an out-of-band console edit looks identical from here — the property is
  reported as drifted with the AWS side shown as `***`. cdkd cannot tell a
  stale secret from a non-secret edit, so it does not print either.
- When AWS returns **nothing** for that exact property, it is reported as
  neither clean nor drifted. A write-only credential (`MasterUserPassword` and
  friends) is not returned by any readback, so an absence there means "cannot
  be checked", not "was removed" — reporting it would make `cdkd drift` exit 1
  forever on every stack with a templated credential. This applies to the
  property itself only: a whole block disappearing (the console's "remove all
  environment variables") IS reported, and `--accept` refuses it, because
  accepting an absence deletes the key and would take the `{{resolve:...}}`
  reference with it. Use `--revert` for that shape.
- `--accept` **refuses** such a property and says so: it will not write `***`
  into state, and it will not write a value it could not identify. The drift
  keeps being reported. Use `--revert` to push the referenced value back to
  AWS, or re-deploy if the reference itself changed. Properties that are not
  secret-bearing are accepted normally in the same run, and `--accept
  --dry-run` prints the same refusal the real run will make.
- `--revert` re-resolves before calling the provider, so the live resource
  receives the concrete secret rather than the literal `{{resolve:...}}`
  token.

**Known limitation.** cdkd cannot mask a value for a reference it never
resolved, so for `{{resolve:ssm-secure:...}}` the protections above are not
complete. The report masks by POSITION and the `--revert` payload declines to
carry such a value, but if a provider echoes its own readback back to cdkd
(`effectiveProperties`, which `--revert` persists as a narrowing) the resolved
value can reach `state.json` with nothing able to recognise it. This predates
the reconciliation described here — that write previously had no redaction at
all — and closing it needs masking by SPAN rather than by value, which is
tracked separately. If that matters for your stack, prefer a
`secretsmanager` or plain `ssm` reference, both of which cdkd resolves and can
therefore mask.

A reference cdkd does not resolve at all — `{{resolve:ssm-secure:...}}` is the
one such spelling today — is **not** an error, and is **not** compared: the
property is reported as neither clean nor drifted, and a warning names the
token once per resource.

What a `--revert` triggered by another drifted property on the same resource
does to those positions depends on where the token sits, and the difference
matters for a stack adopted with `cdkd import --migrate-from-cloudformation`,
where CloudFormation resolved `ssm-secure` server-side so AWS holds the
resolved value while cdkd state holds the literal token:

- If the property's **whole value** is the token, the live value is left
  **unchanged** — cdkd cannot tell what it should be, so it does not touch it.
- If the token is **embedded in a longer string** (`"jdbc:...password={{resolve:ssm-secure:/pw}}"`),
  that string is written **with the token literal**, exactly as `cdkd deploy`
  does — so a resolved value AWS holds there **is overwritten**. Preserving
  this case needs masking by span, which is tracked separately; until then,
  prefer a `secretsmanager` or plain `ssm` reference in a composed string, or
  keep the reference as the property's whole value.

Both the drift warning and the revert warning state which of the two applies,
and the drift one is printed before the confirmation prompt.

Drift detection works automatically for every resource type that goes
through Cloud Control API (the majority of cdkd's surface). SDK
Providers add their own `readCurrentState` incrementally — providers
without an implementation surface as `drift unknown` rather than `clean`,
so you can see exactly which types are still uncovered.

The following SDK Providers ship with first-class `readCurrentState`
(no CC API round-trip):
- `AWS::Lambda::Function`, `AWS::S3::Bucket`, `AWS::DynamoDB::Table`,
  `AWS::IAM::Role`, `AWS::SQS::Queue`, `AWS::SNS::Topic`,
  `AWS::Logs::LogGroup` (PR D, batch 0)
- `AWS::CloudFront::CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentity`,
  `AWS::Events::EventBus`, `AWS::Events::Rule`,
  `AWS::SSM::Parameter`, `AWS::SecretsManager::Secret`,
  `AWS::ECR::Repository`, `AWS::StepFunctions::StateMachine`,
  `AWS::ECS::Cluster`, `AWS::ECS::Service`, `AWS::ECS::TaskDefinition`,
  `AWS::RDS::DBInstance`, `AWS::RDS::DBCluster`,
  `AWS::RDS::DBSubnetGroup`, `AWS::KMS::Key`, `AWS::KMS::Alias`,
  `AWS::ApiGateway::Account`, `AWS::ApiGateway::Method`,
  `AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Api`, `AWS::Cognito::UserPool` (batch 1)
- `AWS::AppSync::GraphQLApi`, `AWS::AppSync::DataSource`,
  `AWS::AppSync::Resolver`, `AWS::AppSync::ApiKey`,
  `AWS::EFS::FileSystem`, `AWS::EFS::AccessPoint`, `AWS::EFS::MountTarget`,
  `AWS::ElastiCache::CacheCluster`, `AWS::ElastiCache::SubnetGroup`,
  `AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::LoadBalancer`,
  `AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::TargetGroup`,
  `AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::Listener`,
  `AWS::Route53::HostedZone`, `AWS::Route53::RecordSet`,
  `AWS::WAFv2::WebACL`,
  `AWS::KinesisFirehose::DeliveryStream`, `AWS::Kinesis::Stream`,
  `AWS::Glue::Database`, `AWS::Glue::Table`,
  `AWS::CloudTrail::Trail`, `AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm`,
  `AWS::CodeBuild::Project`,
  `AWS::ServiceDiscovery::PrivateDnsNamespace`,
  `AWS::ServiceDiscovery::Service`,
  `AWS::SNS::Subscription` (batch 2)
- `AWS::IAM::Policy`, `AWS::Lambda::Permission`,
  `AWS::ApiGateway::Authorizer`, `AWS::ApiGateway::Resource`,
  `AWS::ApiGateway::Deployment`, `AWS::ApiGateway::Stage`,
  `AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Stage`, `AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Integration`,
  `AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Route`, `AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Authorizer`
  (PR G — sub-resource batch; receives `properties` so the parent
  `RestApiId` / `ApiId` / `FunctionName` / `Roles[]` is available to
  issue the matching `Get*` call)
- `AWS::ServiceDiscovery::HttpNamespace`,
  `AWS::ServiceDiscovery::PublicDnsNamespace` (issue #1044)
- `AWS::CloudFront::OriginAccessControl` (SDK provider added to take the
  type off the Cloud Control polling path; the CFn and SDK
  `OriginAccessControlConfig` field names are identical, so the reverse
  mapping is a straight per-field copy)

Tag drift is supported across the SDK Providers listed above (and the CC
API fallback). cdkd filters out CDK / AWS-internal `aws:`-prefixed entries
(notably `aws:cdk:path` and `aws:cdk:metadata`) from the AWS-current
snapshot before comparing — those are injected by CDK as construct
metadata, not as user-managed `Tags` properties, so leaving them in would
fire false-positive drift on every CDK-deployed resource. The remaining
user tags are normalized to CFn's `[{Key, Value}]` shape (sorted by `Key`
for stable comparison) and the result key is omitted entirely when AWS
reports no user tags. IAM Role / User / Group inline-policy bodies are
covered (paginated `List*Policies` + parallel `Get*Policy` round-trips
with state-driven order reconciliation) since PR #175;
see [src/types/resource.ts](../src/types/resource.ts) for the per-provider
shape decisions.

Still reporting `drift unknown` (deferred):

- `AWS::CloudFront::Distribution` defers to the CC API fallback — its
  `DistributionConfig` schema uses the SDK's `Quantity + Items` shape vs
  CFn's flat array shape, and mirroring the conversion would balloon the
  diff for marginal gain over the CC API path.
- `AWS::AppSync::GraphQLSchema` body drift is deferred — AWS's
  `GetIntrospectionSchema` returns SDL bytes but normalizes the schema
  on the way out (canonical field ordering, comment / whitespace
  stripping), so a direct string comparison against the user-authored
  `Definition` in cdkd state would fire constantly on cosmetic diffs.
  A meaningful comparison needs an SDL parser to canonicalize both
  sides before diff, which is out of scope.
- `AWS::Kinesis::StreamConsumer` falls through to the CC API fallback;
  the SDK provider only handles `AWS::Kinesis::Stream`. A dedicated
  SDK impl would require building out create / update / delete first.

`--json` output shape:

```json
[
  {
    "stack": "MyStack",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "drifted": [
      {
        "logicalId": "Bucket1",
        "type": "AWS::S3::Bucket",
        "changes": [
          {
            "path": "VersioningConfiguration.Status",
            "stateValue": "Enabled",
            "awsValue": "Suspended"
          }
        ],
        "referencesUnresolved": false
      }
    ],
    "clean": [
      { "logicalId": "Queue1", "type": "AWS::SQS::Queue", "referencesUnresolved": false }
    ],
    "notSupported": [
      { "logicalId": "Function1", "type": "AWS::Lambda::Function" }
    ],
    "notCompared": []
  }
]
```

The `notCompared` roll-up answers one question `clean` alone cannot:
**was the comparison complete?** When cdkd cannot resolve — or
deliberately REFUSES to resolve — a dynamic reference a resource's state
records, that resource's secret-bearing properties are not compared at
all. The comparator skips those leaves, so nothing is reported as
drifted, which on its own is indistinguishable from "compared and
matched".

Such a resource appears under `notCompared` and **not** under `clean`
(issue [#2135](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2135)): `clean`
means compared-and-matched and nothing else, so its entries always carry
`referencesUnresolved: false`. A `drifted` entry can carry
`referencesUnresolved: true` — the changes it reports are real, but they
are not the whole comparison — and it is rolled up under `notCompared`
as well. Entries in `notCompared` carry `referencesUnresolved: true`
themselves, so the fact is readable off an entry and not only off which
array it sits in.

So a CI job that gates on drift should read `notCompared`, not just
`drifted`:

```bash
# "everything was actually checked, and nothing drifted"
cdkd drift --all --json | jq -e 'all(.[]; .drifted == [] and .notCompared == [])'
```

The human-readable report says the same thing as a
`N resource(s) only PARTIALLY compared` block — the per-resource detail
goes to the log, which a caller piping stdout does not see. The usual
causes are a least-privilege role without `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue`
/ `ssm:GetParameter`, a deleted or rotated-away secret, and a
cross-region reference cdkd refuses to resolve in the consumer's region
because that would compare against (and with `--revert`, write) a
different region's same-named secret.

The comparator only looks at keys present in cdkd state — AWS-managed
fields (timestamps, generated identifiers, account-wide defaults) that
cdkd never set are ignored, so they never surface as false-positive
drift.

### False-drift prevention for the CC API fallback

When an SDK Provider doesn't yet implement `readCurrentState`, drift
falls back to Cloud Control API's generic `GetResource`. cdkd state's
`properties` field is in CFn-template shape (what `provider.create()`
was passed); CC API's response is usually the same shape, but for some
resource types it diverges enough to fire false-positive drift on
every run. Two guards protect the fallback:

1. **Deny-list** (`src/analyzer/drift-cc-api-deny-list.ts`) — types
   with verified structural divergence (e.g. `AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi`'s
   write-only `Body` field, or `AWS::EC2::LaunchTemplate`'s
   version-bumped `LaunchTemplateData`) short-circuit to `drift unknown`
   before the CC API call ever fires. The fix path for any deny-listed
   type is a first-class SDK-provider `readCurrentState`, not a
   per-entry tweak — once the provider implements it, the deny-list
   entry is unreachable.
2. **Strip pass** (`src/analyzer/cc-api-strip.ts`) — known AWS-managed
   timestamp / owner / generated-id fields (`CreationDate`,
   `LastModifiedTime`, `OwnerId`, `RevisionId`, ...) are removed from
   CC API responses before the comparator sees them. The strip list is
   conservative: name-collision-prone fields that some CFn types use
   as legitimate inputs (`Status`, `State`, `VersionId`, `Arn`, ...)
   are NOT stripped, so a real `Status` change on
   `AWS::ECS::CapacityProvider.ManagedScaling` still surfaces as
   drift.

A breadth-of-coverage shape fixture suite
(`tests/unit/analyzer/drift-cc-api-shape-fixtures.test.ts`) verifies
~10 representative CC-API-fallback types produce zero drift on a
clean stack. When a new shape regression is reported, add the type
either to the fixture suite (if the strip list catches it) or to the
deny-list (if the divergence is structural).

### Resolving drift (`--accept` / `--revert`)

Once `cdkd drift` has detected drift, the same command can also resolve
it. The two flags are mutually exclusive — pick the direction that
matches the intent:

- **`--accept`** (state ← AWS) — write the AWS-current values back
  into cdkd's S3 state file. Use this when the AWS-side change is the
  intentional source of truth (typically a manual console edit you want
  cdkd to "catch up" to without re-deploying). The cdkd state ETag
  captured during the read is forwarded to `S3StateBackend.saveState`
  as `IfMatch` for optimistic locking, so a concurrent `cdkd deploy`
  cannot race the write. AWS resources are NOT modified.

- **`--revert`** (AWS ← state) — call each drifted resource's
  `provider.update` to push state values back into AWS for the
  drifted properties. `properties` is built as the AWS-current
  snapshot (captured during the drift read, no second AWS call) with
  the **drifted top-level subtrees overlaid from cdkd's
  `observedProperties`**, and `previousProperties` is the AWS-current
  snapshot itself. Net effect: every drifted property is pushed back
  to its state-recorded value; non-drifted properties carry their
  AWS-current values, so a diff-based `update()` (e.g. SNS, IAM Role)
  sees `newVal === oldVal` for them and does not touch the AWS
  resource for those keys. Use this to undo a manual AWS console
  change. Per-resource failures are collected and surface as
  `PartialFailureError` (exit 2) at the end of the run; one resource's
  failure does not abort the rest. cdkd state is NOT modified by
  `--revert` — once `provider.update` succeeds, AWS values match state
  by definition, so a subsequent `cdkd drift` reports `clean`.

  **Resources with no observed-capture baseline.** The revert baseline is
  `observedProperties ?? properties`. A resource deployed BEFORE
  observed-capture shipped has no `observedProperties`, so the desired side
  is the raw **template** while the previous side would be the AWS-current
  snapshot — and on that baseline cdkd cannot tell an AWS-authored value
  from an out-of-band change, because neither appears in the template.

  So on that baseline the revert **leaves every untemplated value alone**
  (issue [#1626](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1626)): cdkd merges
  those paths into the bag it actually SENDS, instead of overlaying the
  drifted subtree wholesale. Merging on the desired side (rather than trimming
  `previousProperties`) is what makes this hold for both provider shapes — one
  that key-diffs a collection would otherwise put them on its removal path,
  and one that replaces a bag wholesale (`PutBucketTagging` is documented
  full-replace) never consults the previous side at all. The plan
  prints, per affected resource, a `! this resource has no observed-capture
  baseline ... LEAVES N AWS-authored values untouched` line naming each path,
  before the confirmation prompt and under `--dry-run`. A Glue Iceberg
  table's `table_type` / `metadata_location`, and the ~18 untemplated
  attributes an ELBv2 load balancer reports, survive the revert instead of
  being reset. Run **`cdkd state refresh-observed <stack>`** (or re-deploy)
  if you want them reverted too; either populates `observedProperties`, after
  which the baseline IS a deploy-time AWS snapshot — an out-of-band addition
  is then genuinely identifiable and IS stripped, and the notice stops
  firing. Only DRIFTED
  top-level keys are ever narrowed; non-drifted keys keep their AWS-current
  values on both sides.

  **Update-not-supported resources.** Some resource types are immutable
  in AWS (e.g. `AWS::Lambda::LayerVersion`, sub-resource attachments
  like `AWS::Lambda::Permission`, `AWS::ApiGateway::Deployment`) or do
  not yet have an in-place `update()` implementation in cdkd
  (`AWS::AppSync::*`, `AWS::EFS::*`, `AWS::KinesisFirehose::DeliveryStream`,
  `AWS::ApiGatewayV2::*`, `AWS::ApiGateway::Authorizer` /
  `Deployment` / `Method`, `AWS::Glue::Database`,
  `AWS::ServiceDiscovery::*`, `AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::LoadBalancer`).
  For those, `--revert` surfaces a distinct `⊘ <stack>/<id> (<type>):
  could not revert — ...` line with a `ResourceUpdateNotSupportedError`
  and an explicit suggestion. The summary then names them separately
  ("`N reverted, M update-not-supported`") and the run exits `2`. The
  fix is to **re-deploy the stack with `cdkd deploy --replace`**, or
  destroy + redeploy — the same recovery path you would use for a
  CloudFormation immutable-property error. AWS update failures (a
  successful `provider.update()` call returning a runtime error) are
  reported separately with a `✗` glyph and counted as `failed`; the
  fix there is to inspect the AWS error and retry once the underlying
  cause is resolved.

Both flags acquire the per-stack lock (the same one `cdkd deploy` uses)
before mutating anything, and prompt for confirmation unless `-y` /
`--yes` is set. `--dry-run` prints the planned mutations and exits 0
without acquiring a lock or hitting AWS / S3.

`--accept` is a no-op on a clean stack (no drift, nothing to write).
`--revert` is likewise a no-op on a clean stack (no drift, nothing to
push). Resources surfaced as `unsupported` (provider has no
`readCurrentState` yet) are skipped by both flags — the comparator
never produced a `PropertyDrift` for them.

## Destroy data guards: non-empty S3 buckets and image-carrying ECR repositories

`cdkd destroy` (and `cdkd state destroy`) matches CloudFormation's
fail-and-protect behavior for the two resource types whose delete API
refuses by default while they still hold data (issue
[#1340](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1340)):

| Resource type | Without an opt-in | With the opt-in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AWS::S3::Bucket` | A non-empty bucket fails the destroy with an actionable "bucket is not empty" error (CloudFormation: `DELETE_FAILED`; Terraform: requires `force_destroy`). The bucket and every object survive. | CDK `autoDeleteObjects: true` (the `aws-cdk:auto-delete-objects` tag) — cdkd auto-empties all object versions + delete markers before `DeleteBucket`, which also absorbs the race where objects (e.g. ALB access logs) land between the auto-delete custom resource's cleanup and the bucket deletion. |
| `AWS::ECR::Repository` | A repository that still contains images fails the destroy with an actionable "still contains images" error (CloudFormation: `DELETE_FAILED` unless `EmptyOnDelete: true`; Terraform: requires `force_delete`). The repository and images survive. | CDK `emptyOnDelete: true` (`EmptyOnDelete: true` in the template) or the legacy `autoDeleteImages` (`aws-cdk:auto-delete-images` tag) — cdkd deletes with `force: true`. |
| `AWS::S3Express::DirectoryBucket` | A non-empty directory bucket fails the destroy with an actionable "is not empty" error (CloudFormation: `DELETE_FAILED`, live-A/B-verified 2026-08-03; issue [#1344](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1344)). The bucket and objects survive. | Add the `aws-cdk:auto-delete-objects` tag with value `true` to the bucket's `Tags` (a handled property since issue [#609](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/609); CDK has no `autoDeleteObjects` sugar for directory buckets, so declare the tag explicitly on the L1). The opted-in auto-empty absorbs concurrent-write races with the same bounded empty-retry loop as the standard bucket. Alternatively empty the bucket manually (`aws s3 rm s3://<bucket> --recursive` — directory buckets have no versioning) and destroy again. `--force-stateful-recreation` replacement deletes are authorized as for the other types. |

To destroy anyway without redeploying, empty the data first (`aws s3 rm
s3://<bucket> --recursive` — for versioned buckets delete all object
versions and delete markers; `aws ecr batch-delete-image`) and re-run the
destroy.

Replacement deletes during `cdkd deploy` are governed by the existing
stateful-recreation consent instead: passing `--force-stateful-recreation`
(the flag whose documented meaning is "I accept a data-losing recreation")
also authorizes the force-cleanup on the replaced resource's delete.

Related parity notes, verified against real CloudFormation (2026-08-02): CFn
itself hard-deletes `AWS::SecretsManager::Secret` (no recovery window) and
force-detaches out-of-band IAM role policy attachments on delete — cdkd's
identical behavior for those types is parity, not a divergence.

## `DeletionPolicy: Snapshot`: final snapshots on delete (`--skip-final-snapshot`)

CloudFormation creates a **final snapshot before deleting** a resource whose
`DeletionPolicy` is `Snapshot` — and the CDK RDS L2 (`DatabaseInstance` /
`DatabaseCluster`) defaults `removalPolicy` to `SNAPSHOT`, so plain CDK
database stacks rely on it. cdkd matches this on every delete path (issues
[#1352](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1352) /
[#1353](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1353) /
[#1354](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1354) /
[#1358](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1358)): `cdkd destroy`,
`cdkd state destroy`, the `cdkd deploy` DELETE of a resource removed from
the template, the rollback of a CREATE (automatic after a failed deploy, or
`cdkd rollback`), and — for `UpdateReplacePolicy: Snapshot` — the deploy
engine's replacement / recreate deletes of the OLD resource.

| Resource type | How the final snapshot is created |
| --- | --- |
| `AWS::RDS::DBInstance` | `DeleteDBInstance(SkipFinalSnapshot=false, FinalDBSnapshotIdentifier=<generated>)`. CFn nuance matched: an instance that is a **cluster member** (`DBClusterIdentifier` set) is deleted without an instance-level snapshot — cluster-level snapshots cover it. |
| `AWS::RDS::DBCluster` | `DeleteDBCluster(SkipFinalSnapshot=false, FinalDBSnapshotIdentifier=<generated>)` |
| `AWS::Neptune::DBCluster` | `DeleteDBCluster(...FinalDBSnapshotIdentifier)` (Neptune SDK) |
| `AWS::DocDB::DBCluster` | `DeleteDBCluster(...FinalDBSnapshotIdentifier)` (DocDB SDK) |
| `AWS::ElastiCache::CacheCluster` | `DeleteCacheCluster(FinalSnapshotIdentifier=<generated>)` — Redis engine only; a Memcached cluster under `Snapshot` surfaces AWS's rejection, matching CFn's `DELETE_FAILED` |
| `AWS::EC2::Volume` | Pre-delete `CreateSnapshot` (tagged `cdkd:final-snapshot-of: <volumeId>`), **waited to `completed`**, then the normal delete — the type is Cloud-Control-routed and `DeleteVolume` has no snapshot parameter. Idempotent: a destroy re-run reuses the tagged snapshot instead of creating a second one. |
| `AWS::Redshift::Cluster` | Pre-delete `CreateClusterSnapshot` (`<clusterId>-final-<ts>`), **waited to `available`**, then a bounded wait for the CLUSTER itself to settle (the fresh snapshot leaves it busy and the delete would otherwise 400 with "There is an operation running on the Cluster"), then the CC-routed delete (issue #1353). |
| `AWS::ElastiCache::ReplicationGroup` | Pre-delete ElastiCache `CreateSnapshot`, waited to `available`, then the CC-routed delete (issue #1353). The snapshot source depends on cluster mode: a cluster-mode-ENABLED (sharded) group is snapshotted by `ReplicationGroupId`, while the cluster-mode-DISABLED default must name its PRIMARY member cache cluster instead (AWS rejects the group form with "Please specify a cache cluster instead") — cdkd resolves this automatically. Redis only; Memcached / snapshot-incapable node types surface AWS's rejection, matching CFn's `DELETE_FAILED`. |

Generated snapshot identifiers are deterministic and logged:
`<physicalId>-final-<utcTimestamp>` (sanitized to the snapshot-identifier
character rules).

`--skip-final-snapshot` (on `cdkd deploy`, `cdkd destroy`, `cdkd state
destroy`, and `cdkd rollback`) is the explicit opt-out: delete WITHOUT the
final snapshot (data loss — useful for dev/test stacks where the snapshot
cost/latency is unwanted, and the escape hatch for the cc-api-routed refusal
below).

Notes:

- The recorded `state.deletionPolicy` (schema v5+) is what the destroy paths
  consult; pre-v5 state keeps the legacy plain-delete behavior until a
  redeploy records the attribute (`cdkd destroy` also falls back to the
  synth template's `DeletionPolicy` for pre-v5 state).
- A Cloud-Control-routed resource of an atomic-parameter type (state
  records `provisionedBy: cc-api` — the #614 silent-drop routing) is
  **refused**: Cloud Control's `DeleteResource` has no final-snapshot
  parameter, so cdkd cannot honor the policy on that route. Snapshot
  manually, then re-run with `--skip-final-snapshot`.
- `UpdateReplacePolicy: Snapshot` is honored on the deploy engine's
  replacement / recreate delete sites (issue #1354) with the same mechanism
  matrix; the `--force-stateful-recreation` stateful guard still applies
  first where the replacement is data-losing. Failure handling differs by
  site, deliberately: the delete-first / recreate paths surface a snapshot
  failure as a resource failure (their delete is load-bearing for the
  re-create), while the post-replacement CLEANUP delete keeps its
  warn-and-continue policy for a TRANSIENT snapshot failure — it skips the
  delete, so the old resource is leaked with a warning rather than deleted
  un-snapshotted. A REFUSAL (a type / route cdkd cannot snapshot) always
  fails the resource, matching CloudFormation failing the update.
- Rolling back a COMPLETED CREATE (the automatic rollback after a failed
  deploy, or `cdkd rollback`) IS a delete, so `DeletionPolicy: Snapshot`
  applies to it:
  cdkd creates the final snapshot and then deletes, using the same mechanism
  matrix as the table above, and REFUSES (counting the op as a rollback
  failure, so the journal is kept for a re-run) any shape it cannot snapshot
  — pass `--skip-final-snapshot` to `cdkd rollback` to delete without it
  (issue #1358). Before #1358 such a resource was ORPHANED — dropped from
  state and left running in AWS — which silently handed you an untracked,
  billing resource. `DeletionPolicy: Retain` still orphans (that is what the
  policy asks for).
- `cdkd rollback --revert-failed`'s delete of a resource whose CREATE FAILED
  mid-flight applies the SAME policy matrix (issue
  [#1362](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1362)): `Retain` leaves it in
  AWS, `Snapshot` snapshots then deletes (refusing what it cannot snapshot),
  `RetainExceptOnCreate` / `Delete` / absent delete plainly. That branch read
  no policy at all before #1362. It only engages when AWS actually provisioned
  the resource — the action requires a recorded physical id AND a matching
  state record — so the policy is never applied to a resource that never
  existed. A refusal here is recoverable rather than final: the op stays in
  the journal, so once a half-created resource settles into a snapshot-capable
  state (an RDS instance rejects a final-snapshot delete while `creating`) a
  re-run completes it, and `--skip-final-snapshot` is the opt-out if you would
  rather drop the data.
- On a ROLLBACK's delete-of-the-NEW-resource (reversing a replacement, i.e.
  `UpdateReplacePolicy`), only the atomic SDK-routed types get a final
  snapshot — the other shapes deliberately keep the plain delete (that
  delete is load-bearing for same-name re-creation; recorded on issue
  #1354).
- Snapshot reuse across a re-run resumes only an IN-FLIGHT snapshot for the
  name-keyed APIs (Redshift / ElastiCache): their identifiers are
  user-chosen and reusable, so adopting an already-`available` snapshot
  could hand you a PREVIOUS generation's data. A re-run after the snapshot
  completed therefore creates a second (timestamped, non-colliding) one.
  EC2 Volume reuses a completed snapshot safely — its tag is keyed on an
  AWS-generated volume id that is never reused.
- Final snapshots are billed AWS resources that survive the destroy by
  design — delete them manually when no longer needed.

## `--remove-protection`: bypass deletion protection on destroy

`cdkd destroy --remove-protection` and `cdkd state destroy
--remove-protection` flip every protection flag off in-place
before each provider's delete API call so the destroy proceeds
without an intermediate edit / redeploy / console click. Covers
**stack-level** `terminationProtection` (the bypass logs a WARN
line naming the stack — `cdkd state destroy` already ignores
`terminationProtection` because the flag is a CDK property
surfaced via synth, so the flag is effectively a no-op there for
that part) AND **resource-level** protection on the following
types:

| Resource type | Protection field | Bypass call |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AWS::Logs::LogGroup` | `DeletionProtectionEnabled` | `PutLogGroupDeletionProtection(deletionProtectionEnabled=false)` |
| `AWS::RDS::DBInstance` | `DeletionProtection` | `ModifyDBInstance(DeletionProtection=false, ApplyImmediately=true)` |
| `AWS::RDS::DBCluster` | `DeletionProtection` | `ModifyDBCluster(DeletionProtection=false, ApplyImmediately=true)` |
| `AWS::DocDB::DBCluster` | `DeletionProtection` | `ModifyDBCluster(DeletionProtection=false, ApplyImmediately=true)` (DocDB SDK) — DocDB DBInstance has no `DeletionProtection` field, so no per-instance bypass; cluster-level covers the common case |
| `AWS::Neptune::DBCluster` | `DeletionProtection` | `ModifyDBCluster(DeletionProtection=false, ApplyImmediately=true)` (Neptune SDK) |
| `AWS::Neptune::DBInstance` | `DeletionProtection` | `ModifyDBInstance(DeletionProtection=false, ApplyImmediately=true)` (Neptune SDK) |
| `AWS::DynamoDB::Table` | `DeletionProtectionEnabled` | `UpdateTable(DeletionProtectionEnabled=false)` then `DescribeTable` poll until `ACTIVE` |
| `AWS::EC2::Instance` | `DisableApiTermination` | `ModifyInstanceAttribute(DisableApiTermination={Value:false})` |
| `AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::LoadBalancer` | attribute `deletion_protection.enabled` | `ModifyLoadBalancerAttributes([{Key: 'deletion_protection.enabled', Value: 'false'}])` |
| `AWS::Cognito::UserPool` | `DeletionProtection` (`ACTIVE` / `INACTIVE`) | `UpdateUserPool(DeletionProtection='INACTIVE')` |
| `AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup` | `DeletionProtection` (`none` / `prevent-force-deletion` / `prevent-all-deletion`) | `UpdateAutoScalingGroup(DeletionProtection='none')` followed by `DeleteAutoScalingGroup(ForceDelete=true)` so AWS terminates running instances as part of the delete |
| `AWS::DSQL::Cluster` | `DeletionProtectionEnabled` | Cloud Control `UpdateResource` patch (`[{op: add, path: /DeletionProtectionEnabled, value: false}]`), waited to completion, then `DeleteResource` — the generic CC-routed protection flip (issue #1312); more CC-routed types with a top-level protection property can join the registry in `src/provisioning/cc-protection-properties.ts` once live-verified (remaining candidates tracked in issue #1315) |
| `AWS::NeptuneGraph::Graph` | `DeletionProtection` | Same generic CC patch flip (`value: false`) then `DeleteResource` (issue #1314) |
| `AWS::SMSVOICE::ProtectConfiguration` | `DeletionProtectionEnabled` | Same generic CC patch flip (`value: false`) then `DeleteResource` (issue #1314) |
| `AWS::VerifiedPermissions::PolicyStore` | `DeletionProtection` (`{Mode: ENABLED\|DISABLED}`) | Same generic CC patch flip with `value: {Mode: DISABLED}` then `DeleteResource` (issue #1314) |
| `AWS::EKS::Cluster` | `DeletionProtection` | Same generic CC patch flip (`value: false`) then `DeleteResource` (issue #1315) |
| `AWS::RDS::GlobalCluster` | `DeletionProtection` | Same generic CC patch flip (`value: false`) then `DeleteResource` (issue #1315) |
| `AWS::DocDB::GlobalCluster` | `DeletionProtection` | Same generic CC patch flip (`value: false`) then `DeleteResource` (issue #1315) |

Behavior:

- The flip-off call is **idempotent** — providers always issue it
  when the flag is set, regardless of whether the resource
  currently has protection on. AWS accepts the no-op (already-
  disabled) case without error.
- A failure of the flip-off itself (NotFound / similar) is logged
  at debug; the actual delete API call still runs and surfaces
  its own error message.
- This is **per-PR-level**: a single `--remove-protection` covers
  every protection-bearing type listed above. There is no per-
  type variant. If you need finer control, run a stack-only
  destroy and clean up the rest manually.
- The interactive confirmation prompt is updated when the flag is
  set: `About to destroy N resources from stack "X", REMOVING
  DELETION PROTECTION on K of them. Continue? (y/N)`. The
  default flips from `Y/n` to `y/N`. `--yes` / `-y` / `-f`
  skips the prompt.
- **RDS / Cognito gating change**: prior to this flag, the RDS
  DBInstance / DBCluster providers always issued
  `ModifyDB{Instance,Cluster}` with `DeletionProtection: false`
  before destroy, and the Cognito UserPool provider always issued
  `DescribeUserPool` + (if `ACTIVE`) `UpdateUserPool
  (DeletionProtection='INACTIVE')` before destroy. Both implicit
  behaviors are now gated on `--remove-protection` to match the
  other types — destroying an RDS or Cognito UserPool resource
  whose deletion protection was set externally (console / AWS CLI)
  without `--remove-protection` will surface AWS's
  `InvalidParameterCombination` / `InvalidParameterException`
  error rather than silently succeed.
- Protection types not in the table above (CloudFront
  Distributions, S3 bucket retention, etc.) are out of scope —
  the list is curated to the cases where AWS exposes a
  synchronous "flip protection off" API call.

```bash
# Stack with terminationProtection: true OR a protected DynamoDB / RDS / Logs / EC2 / LB
cdkd destroy MyStack --remove-protection
cdkd destroy --all --remove-protection -y

# CDK-app-free counterpart — the resource-level flip applies the same way;
# stack-level terminationProtection is already ignored by `state destroy`.
cdkd state destroy MyStack --remove-protection -y
```

## `--purge-events`: also delete deployment-event history on destroy

By default `cdkd destroy` removes `state.json` / `lock.json` but **keeps** the
stack's deployment-event history (the issue #808 `deployments/` store) as
post-mortem context — so the state bucket does not return fully empty after a
teardown. `cdkd destroy <stack> --purge-events` (issue
[#885](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/885)) opts into purging that
history too, so the bucket returns to empty:

```bash
cdkd destroy MyStack --purge-events -y
```

- The purge runs **only after a clean, non-interrupted destroy** of that
  stack. On a failed / interrupted destroy the events are kept — they are
  exactly the post-mortem you want when retrying.
- Best-effort: a purge failure logs a warning but never fails the
  already-successful destroy.
- `state destroy` does NOT take this flag; for an already-destroyed stack (or
  the CDK-app-free path) use the equivalent `cdkd events prune <stack> --all`.
- Per-stack: when destroying multiple stacks, each clean stack's history is
  purged independently.

## `cdkd scrub` (state secret hygiene: clean + audit)

cdkd resolves CloudFormation dynamic references (`{{resolve:secretsmanager:...}}`,
and `{{resolve:ssm:...}}` pointing at a **SecureString** parameter)
to their concrete value so the secret can be handed to the AWS API on
create / update. When it PERSISTS state, it stores the UNRESOLVED expression
rather than the resolved plaintext, so the secret never lands in `state.json`,
`cdkd state show`, `cdkd diff`, or `cdkd drift` output — this matches
CloudFormation, which keeps the reference in the template and resolves it
service-side. A rotated secret behind an unchanged reference is a no-op on the
next deploy (again matching CloudFormation), and `cdkd diff` makes no live
secret fetch.

`cdkd scrub` is the permanent home for that concern: the one command that keeps
cdkd state free of sensitive plaintext and audits that it stays that way. Two
modes, both useful long after any one-time migration:

- **Clean** — rewrite existing state in place, WITHOUT redeploying. This is what
  you run after upgrading cdkd on a stack you do not want to re-provision, or
  any time you suspect a state file predates a redaction fix.
- **Audit** — `--dry-run --fail` exits 1 when any plaintext secret is still in
  state, so it works as a STANDING CI gate rather than incident-only tooling.
  Secrets landing in IaC state is a structural, recurring concern (the same
  class Terraform has), so it is worth asserting continuously:

```yaml
# CI: fail the build if any cdkd state file holds a plaintext secret.
- run: cdkd scrub --all --dry-run --fail
```

A normal `cdkd deploy` scrubs state this way as a side effect, so a green gate is
the expected steady state rather than something you have to maintain. The
commands:

```bash
# Rewrite state so plaintext secrets become their {{resolve:...}} expression
cdkd scrub MyStack

# Report what would change without writing state
cdkd scrub MyStack --dry-run

# CI gate: exit 1 if any plaintext secret remains in state
cdkd scrub MyStack --dry-run --fail

# Every stack in the synthesized app
cdkd scrub --all
```

**Needs the CDK app.** Unlike the `cdkd state ...` family, `scrub` requires
`--app` (or `CDKD_APP` / `cdk.json`) because a state file records the resolved
value with no marker of which values are secrets — only the template carries
the `{{resolve:...}}` references. `scrub` synthesizes the template, re-resolves
each resource's properties to learn the resolved secret VALUES (recorded, never
printed or re-persisted), and replaces those values in the state record's
`properties` / `attributes` / `observedProperties` with the expression. It
performs no AWS create / update / delete — only `state.json` is rewritten,
under the stack lock.

**Scrubbing does not un-expose an already-leaked secret.** A value that was
ever stored in plaintext should be treated as compromised and ROTATED in
Secrets Manager; `scrub` only stops it being re-read out of state going
forward. **Run `scrub` BEFORE rotating**: it matches the CURRENT resolved
secret value against what state holds, so once the secret is rotated the stale
value in state no longer matches and `scrub` reports "nothing to scrub" (the
rotation invalidates the stale value; a redeploy rewrites the record with the
expression). Exit codes: 0 (scrubbed / nothing to do), 1 (`--fail` found
plaintext: with `--dry-run` any plaintext at all, and on a REAL run a leak
scrub cannot rewrite — a state KEY holding a secret, which needs an
`Export.Name` change plus a redeploy, issue
[#1919](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1919)), 2 (error).

**A cross-stack read that cannot be resolved is now a REFUSAL, not a silent
pass** (issue [#2133](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2133)). `scrub`
learns which plaintexts to hunt for by re-resolving the template, so a leaf that
arrives through `Fn::ImportValue` / `Fn::GetStackOutput` yields a needle only if
the producer's state can actually be read. Until #2133 it could not be: no
resolve context carried a state backend, the read threw, and the throw was
absorbed by the per-item best-effort handler that exists so a partially
resolvable template still gets scrubbed for everything else. With no needle
nothing matched, so the command reported no plaintext found over state that may
still have held it. Such a read is now attempted before the main pass and
refuses with `SCRUB_CROSS_STACK_READ_UNRESOLVED` (exit 2) naming the resource or
output it could not resolve. Everything else the best-effort handler swallows is
unchanged -- a `Ref` to a resource absent from state still degrades to a partial
scrub rather than failing the run, which is what that handler is for. Two
consequences worth expecting: a stack whose producer state is unreadable (a
deleted producer, a cross-account export, a missing state file) now exits 2
where it previously exited 0, and under `--all` that refusal is per stack, so
the remaining stacks are still scrubbed and the run ends non-zero naming the
ones it could not examine. A conditional import does NOT refuse when its branch
is not taken: the pre-pass walks `Fn::If` the way the resolver does, selected
branch only, and neither does a `Fn::ImportValue` inside an output that this
run's conditions SUPPRESS -- such an output wrote no state key, so there is
nothing behind it to protect. The same branch selection now decides whether the
PRODUCER's export counts as secret-bearing at all (issue
[go-to-k/cdkd#2150](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2150)): that test
used to scan the whole output node as text, so an `Fn::If` whose UNTAKEN arm
held a `{{resolve:...}}` expression made the export look secret-bearing while
the deployed value was the plain branch -- and the refusal below then fired over
a stored value nothing could turn into an expression, with no bypass flag. One
selection now feeds both halves of the question.

**Which branch scrub selects is evaluated against the template's DEFAULT
parameter values.** `scrub` takes no `--parameters`, so it has nothing else to
evaluate a `Conditions` entry with, and a condition it cannot evaluate reads as
false. For a stack deployed with NON-default parameters that means scrub can
pick a branch the deploy never took -- and in a RESOURCE position, unlike an
output position, a cross-stack read on that branch still refuses (exit 2), so
the stack can be refused over a producer that legitimately does not exist for
the parameters it was actually deployed with. An output position is already
spared this: `state.outputs` records what the deploy really wrote, and a key
absent from it disarms the refusal. There is no equivalent record for a
resource-position branch, so the practical remedies are to make the read
resolvable -- deploy or scrub the producer that branch names, which
`cdkd scrub --all` does in one run by ordering producers before consumers --
rather than to re-run unchanged.

**A cross-stack read that SUCCEEDS but whose PRODUCER still stores the
plaintext refuses too** (`SCRUB_CROSS_STACK_PRODUCER_PLAINTEXT`, exit 2). scrub
can only replace a stored plaintext with the `{{resolve:...}}` expression the
PRODUCER holds, and a producer whose own state has not been scrubbed yet still
holds the plaintext itself -- so the read succeeds, there is no expression to
write, and the consumer would be reported clean over a record that still holds
the secret. The verdict is taken by READING the producer's own stored value, not
by inspecting what the read returned: the read RESOLVES a stored expression to
plaintext before handing it over, so a healthy producer and an unscrubbed one
are indistinguishable from the consumer's side. The refusal names the producer
and the fix: `cdkd scrub <producer>` first, then re-run.

Whether the export is SECRET-BEARING AT ALL is the half of the question the
stored value cannot answer either -- a bucket name and a leaked password are
both bare strings, so refusing on the stored value alone would refuse every
multi-stack app that imports anything. That half is taken from the app's
TEMPLATES, and the refusal fires only when they say the value carries a secret:
either the producer declares that export from a `{{resolve:...}}` expression, or
the producer RE-EXPORTS a value that a stack further up the chain declares from
one (issue [go-to-k/cdkd#2146](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2146)).
Both arms read the export through the SAME `Fn::If` branch selection described
above, so an expression sitting only in a branch this run does not select
answers neither of them -- and the residual is stated rather than implied: a
secret reachable only through that branch is not detected, which is the outcome
that reference had before this refusal existed. An
ordinary import of a bucket name or an ARN is unaffected under either arm. The chain arm
is not a refinement: a middle stack's output IS the `Fn::ImportValue`, so asking
that one template answered "not secret-bearing", and `cdkd scrub <the stack at
the end of the chain>` then reported clean over its own surviving plaintext --
invisibly under `--all`, which scrubs producers first and so heals the chain
before that stack is reached, and reachably under the single-stack form this
page documents. The walk follows `Fn::ImportValue` / `Fn::GetStackOutput`
through the synthesized templates and terminates on a cycle by never revisiting
a `(stack, export)` pair; for a chain the remedy names EVERY stack in it, head
first, because a middle stack cannot store the expression until its own producer
has been scrubbed. What remains unclassifiable from the consumer's side is still
not refused: a producer outside the synthesized app, one whose export cdkd
resolved through CloudFormation rather than through cdkd state, a re-export
whose upstream reference cannot be read statically (an assembled export name, or
an `Fn::GetStackOutput` whose stack or output name is itself an intrinsic), and
one whose upstream export is declared under a name this run cannot reproduce --
which usually means an intrinsic `Export.Name` one hop up, so a stack DOES
declare it and the walk simply cannot match it. When the producer's
`Export.Name` is an intrinsic this run cannot reproduce, the check widens to
every output of THAT producer -- an over-approximation in the safe direction,
and the message says so rather than claiming the producer declares that
particular key from an expression. Note the asymmetry, which is deliberate: the
same input WIDENS at the direct producer and is DROPPED one hop up. At the root
the key came from an actual read, so some output of that producer really did
answer it and refusing over the set is the safe reading; one hop up the key is a
literal name read out of a template, so a miss means that template does not
declare it, and widening there would refuse the consumer over an unrelated
secret two stacks away in a refusal no `cdkd scrub` could clear.

`cdkd scrub --all` now scrubs PRODUCERS BEFORE CONSUMERS (CDK's own stack
dependencies plus raw `Fn::ImportValue` / `Fn::GetStackOutput` edges inferred
from the templates), so one run normally scrubs a producer and then resolves its
expression in the consumer. `--dry-run` writes nothing, so the producer is never
rewritten -- a dry run over a not-yet-scrubbed producer is exactly where this
refusal is expected.

**An ASSEMBLED secret reference whose region cannot answer is a finding too**
(issue [go-to-k/cdkd#2157](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2157)). A
reference the intrinsics build out of parts -- an `Fn::Sub` placeholder inside
it, an `Fn::Join` that splits it -- does not exist as a complete expression
until it is resolved, so `scrub`'s region pre-pass cannot classify it and hands
it to the resolver, which decides the region AFTER assembly and routes it to the
region its ARN names. When that region then cannot answer -- a denied read, a
deleted secret -- no needle is recorded for that leaf, so the stack is NOT
reported clean: scrub warns naming the leaf, and `--fail` exits non-zero. It is
a finding rather than the exit-2 refusal its complete-token twin raises
(`SCRUB_CROSS_REGION_SECRET_UNRESOLVED`) because the failure surfaces from a
whole-bag resolution and cannot be attributed to that leaf, so refusing would
strand a stack over an unrelated unresolvable `Ref`. Unlike the by-design
finding below, this one IS fixable: make that region resolve the reference, or
spell it as one complete literal `{{resolve:...}}`, and re-run.

**A read cdkd declines BY DESIGN is a finding, not a refusal.** The
cross-account `Fn::GetStackOutput` of a redacted value is never resolved: cdkd
will not look up a producer account's secret with the consumer's credentials.
That read cannot be made to succeed by re-running, so refusing the whole stack
would strand every other secret in it. Instead the stack is scrubbed for
everything else, the read is reported (`N cross-stack read(s) in <stack> could
NOT be verified`), the summary says so, and `--fail` exits non-zero -- the same
treatment a secret-bearing output KEY gets. That treatment is scoped to THAT ONE
read. Other refusals the resolver raises deliberately -- a stale placeholder
ARN, an unresolvable account id, an unenriched `Fn::GetAtt`, `--strict-getatt`,
a malformed `Fn::Split` -- are all things you can FIX in the template, so they
refuse the stack (exit 2) with the resolver's own message, and a re-run after
the fix scrubs it. They are reachable here whenever the reference's export name
is built by an `Fn::Sub` over one of them.

**SSM parameters are redacted by TYPE, not by spelling** (issue
[#1901](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1901)). The plain
`{{resolve:ssm:...}}` form resolves with `WithDecryption`, so it yields a real
secret whenever the parameter is a `SecureString` — the same disclosure class
as `{{resolve:secretsmanager:...}}`. cdkd reads the parameter's `Type` off the
same `GetParameter` response that carries the value and treats the two cases
differently:

- **`SecureString`** — handled exactly like a Secrets Manager reference: the
  decrypted value goes to the AWS API, state stores the `{{resolve:ssm:...}}`
  expression, and `cdkd scrub` cleans it out of state written by an older cdkd.
- **`String` / `StringList`** — public config, stored RESOLVED in state as
  before, so a parameter-backed property is not a perpetual spurious UPDATE.

On the diff / no-op comparison path cdkd still has to learn the type, so it
issues `GetParameter` with `WithDecryption: false` — a `SecureString` comes back
as its encrypted blob, which is never substituted, cached, or persisted, and the
comparison stays expression-vs-expression. Once a reference is known to be
`SecureString`, later comparisons short-circuit with no AWS call at all.

**Two spellings of one secret value.** Two dynamic references that resolve to
the SAME value — for example the same JSON key written once with and once
without an explicit version stage — used to collapse in the redaction map,
which is keyed by the resolved value, so both sites persisted whichever
expression was recorded last and the stack reported a spurious UPDATE on every
deploy. No plaintext was ever exposed; the wrong EXPRESSION was stored. cdkd
now redacts by POSITION as well as by value: each leaf is matched against the
UNRESOLVED template at the same path, so it keeps its own expression (issues
[#1904](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1904) /
[#1910](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1910)). Where the template leaf
is an intrinsic (`Fn::Join` / `Fn::Sub` — what CDK emits whenever the secret's
ARN is a `Ref`, so the common case) the reference is identified by the shape of
that intrinsic instead
([#1916](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1916)).

A narrow residual remains, and it degrades to the old behavior rather than to
anything worse: when the intrinsic's literal parts cannot tell the two
references apart — the part that differs is itself behind a `Ref` — cdkd
declines to guess and both leaves persist the same expression again. The same
applies to a pair of `{{resolve:ssm:...}}` references whose parameter `Type`
AWS did not report. If you hit a spurious UPDATE on a resource holding two
spellings of one secret, make the differing part a literal in the template.

**Stack OUTPUTS are scrubbed too, including an output you have since DELETED**
(issue [#2005](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2005)). A stored output
key today's template can still name — a declared output, or an `Export.Name`
alias this run can fully resolve — is redacted by POSITION against that
template, like any resource property. A key the template can no longer name is
the population `cdkd scrub` is recommended for and used to be unable to repair:
the set of secrets `scrub` matched the outputs bag against was built from
today's DECLARED outputs, so an output removed in an ordinary refactor
contributed nothing to it and its stored plaintext survived a scrub that
reported success. Such a key is now repaired whenever its stored value MATCHES a
secret plaintext recorded anywhere in this run — including one only a RESOURCE
still references, which is the usual shape after deleting the output that used
to expose it.

A deleted output is the motivating case but not the whole population: **any
stored key this run cannot COMPUTE** is repaired the same way. The standing
example is a parameterized `Export.Name` — `scrub` takes no `--parameters`, so
a name that resolves to a literal `prefix-${Foo}` here leaves the real alias key
your deploy wrote unaccounted on every run, and that key is value-matched rather
than positioned for as long as the parameter stays unresolvable. Declare the
export name literally, or give the parameter a `Default` the template resolves
from, if you want that key positioned instead.

Two things `scrub` deliberately does NOT do here. `state.outputs` is re-applied
VERBATIM to other stacks — cdkd's exports index and every `Fn::ImportValue` /
`Fn::GetStackOutput` read it — so a value rewritten that was never a secret
ships a literal `{{resolve:...}}` token into a CONSUMER stack's AWS call:

- **It never guesses.** When nothing this run recorded that plaintext — the
  secret was deleted, rotated away, or its reference is gone from the template
  as well — the value is left exactly as it is, no key is invented, and no key
  is removed. `ROTATE` the secret and redeploy; that rewrites the record. A
  degenerately short plaintext (under 4 characters) is excluded from the WIDENED
  match specifically: it is never used as a cross-resource needle, since it
  would match unrelated values. A key the template still names is unaffected —
  it is redacted by template POSITION, so a short secret stored there is still
  repaired.
- **It matches inside a value, and that has a stated cost.** A recorded
  plaintext of 4 characters or more is repaired even when it is EMBEDDED in a
  longer stored value — which is what repairs a connection string built around
  a password, the shape this exists for. The consequence is that a short,
  word-like secret (`admin` as a `secretValueFromJson('username')`) occurring
  inside an unrelated key the template can no longer name is rewritten too, and
  a consumer importing that key then receives a literal `{{resolve:...}}`
  token. The trade is deliberate: that failure is loud and fixable on the next
  deploy, whereas an unrepaired plaintext under a key no template declares is
  silent and no redeploy ever clears it. If it bites, edit the key out of the
  state record — and rotate the secret, which was exposed either way.
- **It does not widen the match for a key the template still names.** Those
  keep their template position, so one resource's secret value can never
  rewrite a declared output's coinciding literal into that resource's
  reference. The residual: a declared output whose template value no longer
  resolves a secret but whose STORED value is still the stale plaintext of one
  is not repaired by `scrub` either — a redeploy rewrites it.

Until this shipped, such a record was correctly WITHHELD from `cdkd diff`'s
display ([#1948](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1948)) and not
repairable; the diff-side refusal is unchanged, since it still cannot decide
from a stored string alone whether a value is a plaintext.

**Secrets inside a LIST are redacted too, including on a resource that did not
change** (issue [#1915](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1915)). A
reference nested in an array — an ECS task definition's
`ContainerDefinitions[].Environment[]` is the usual shape — used to keep its
resolved plaintext in the record's `observedProperties` (the drift baseline)
whenever the resource was UNCHANGED on that deploy, because the resource is
never re-resolved then and AWS does not return list elements in the template's
order. cdkd now matches list elements by their identity field (`Name` / `Key`)
rather than by position, which does not depend on order, so the leaf is
redacted like any other. Elements that carry no such identity field are left
alone rather than guessed at, so nothing is ever written onto the wrong
element; a redaction cdkd cannot place falls back to matching by value.

**A secret whose value is itself a `{{resolve:...}}` string is redacted**
(issue [#1917](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1917)). Such a value is
byte-identical to an already-redacted expression, and cdkd used to keep any
such leaf verbatim — which persisted the plaintext. cdkd now asks a narrower
question: does the reference it is being compared against describe the SAME
generation of the resource? Only a resource's own stored properties can answer
yes; a template never can, whichever command is running. When the answer is no,
the leaf is matched by VALUE instead — so a plaintext cdkd resolved this run is
still replaced by its own reference, while a reference already in state is left
exactly as it is. A legacy leaf of this shape is cleaned the next time either
`cdkd deploy` or `cdkd scrub` resolves that secret.

**A value match never rewrites a fragment INSIDE a complete `{{resolve:...}}`
reference** (issue [#1935](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1935)). A
stored value can hold a reference inside surrounding text —
`jdbc://appdb:{{resolve:secretsmanager:appdb/creds:SecretString:password}}@host`
is what a joined connection string looks like after redaction — and a LATER
deploy can record a secret whose plaintext (`appdb`) also occurs inside that
reference's own text. Rewriting it there produced
`{{resolve:secretsmanager:{{resolve:ssm:/app/dbname}}/creds:...}}`, which no
service can resolve: `cdkd rollback` reads it as a request for the secret id
`{{resolve:ssm:/app/dbname` and either refuses or applies the wrong value.

cdkd now replaces every match of a recorded secret EXCEPT one that lies wholly
inside a complete reference and is shorter than it. A stored secret whose own
value IS a reference is still replaced, and so is one that CONTAINS a whole
reference plus surrounding text — dropping those would leave the plaintext in
state, which is worse than the mangling this rule prevents. Nothing else about
substring matching changes: an embedded secret in ordinary text is repaired
exactly as before.

Three limits worth knowing, all of them narrow. A STRAY `{{resolve:` — an
opener that is not part of a real reference — is read by the same grammar the
resolver uses, and which way it falls depends on what follows it in that same
value:

- With **no later `}}`** it is not a reference at all, so it protects nothing
  and a secret after it is still replaced. Leaving the plaintext there instead
  would hide it behind two characters any string can contain.
- With a **`}}` anywhere later**, the opener and that `}}` bracket one region,
  and a secret inside it is left alone. This is the one shape where cdkd redacts
  less than it did before this change. It is not fixed by narrowing what counts
  as a reference: that would disagree with the resolver about the same string,
  and would re-mangle values an older cdkd already mangled. Such a value cannot
  come from a template — it would fail to resolve at deploy time — so the way it
  arrives is a drift readback (`observedProperties`), which is arbitrary text
  from AWS.

And a value already mangled by an older cdkd is not repaired: it parses as a
valid reference now, so neither a redeploy nor `cdkd scrub` rewrites it. Fixing
such a record means editing it out of state, or redeploying the resource so the
leaf is written afresh.

**A reference you have edited but not deployed is never rewritten** — by
`cdkd scrub` or by `cdkd deploy`. If state holds `...:AWSPREVIOUS` and the
template now says `...:AWSCURRENT`, scrub leaves the record alone and reports
nothing to scrub, and a deploy that fails and rolls back leaves the reverted
reference in place. Rewriting either would make the next `cdkd deploy` compare
the new expression against itself, see no change, and never push the edit to
AWS — a credential rotation that silently never happens, invisible to
`cdkd drift` because the baseline would have been rewritten too. The same rule
covers the drift baseline: `observedProperties` keeps the reference AWS was
last seen holding, so `cdkd drift --revert` cannot push an undeployed one.

**Known limitation.** Two paths do not yet inherit this redaction, both because
they resolve a reference through a context that does not record secrets:

- A secret reference used as a NESTED STACK's `Parameters` value is resolved by
  the parent and handed to the child as a literal, so the child stack's own
  state records the plaintext, and `cdkd diff --recursive` decrypts it at plan
  time.
- `cdkd export` writes the resolved value into the exported CloudFormation
  template's Parameter value, so the plaintext lands in the template it hands
  to CloudFormation.

Both apply to `{{resolve:secretsmanager:...}}` as well as to a `SecureString`
parameter, and are tracked as issue
[#1903](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1903).

## `cdkd rollback` (revert a failed deploy)

`cdkd rollback [STACK]` reverts a stack to its pre-deploy state after a
deploy that failed with `--no-rollback`, was interrupted with Ctrl+C, or
whose automatic rollback died partway. It is the cdkd equivalent of
`cdk rollback` / CloudFormation `RollbackStack`, and the third option (next
to fix-forward `cdkd deploy` and clean-up `cdkd destroy`) after such a
failure. Issue [#1183](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1183).

**Synth-free.** Everything it needs lives in cdkd state plus a **rollback
journal** — the exact `CompletedOperation[]` of the failed deploy, persisted
to `s3://bucket/cdkd/{stack}/{region}/rollback-journal.json` (a sibling of
`state.json`) whenever a deploy ends without a completed rollback. The
command loads that journal and replays it in reverse (delete created
resources; restore updated ones to their previous properties) via the same
rollback executor the in-process automatic rollback uses. No CDK app is
needed — a broken app is a common reason to roll back.

```bash
cdkd rollback MyStack          # roll back one stack
cdkd rollback                  # no arg: the single journaled stack (else lists candidates, exits 1)
cdkd rollback MyStack --force  # skip the confirmation prompt
cdkd rollback MyStack --orphan MyBucket --orphan MyTable
cdkd rollback MyStack --skip-final-snapshot   # DeletionPolicy: Snapshot → delete without the snapshot
cdkd rollback MyStack --stack-region us-west-2
```

Flags:

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--force` | Skip the confirmation prompt (`-y` / `--yes` also works). |
| `--orphan <logicalId>` | Repeatable. Skip the resource during replay, like `cdk rollback --orphan`. An orphaned CREATE is left in AWS and removed from state; an orphaned UPDATE is left at its new properties with state kept as-is. |
| `--revert-failed` | Also attempt to revert the resource whose operation **FAILED** mid-deploy (issue [#1198](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1198)). Off by default because the failed resource's remote state is unknown (the op died partway): a failed UPDATE is force-reverted to its pre-deploy properties (the journal records the *attempted* properties, so patch-based providers generate a real undo diff); a failed CREATE that recorded no physical id is skipped with a warning; a failed DELETE needs no revert (the resource is still in place). A failed CREATE that DID get provisioned honors its `DeletionPolicy` on the way out (issue [#1362](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1362)): `Retain` leaves it in AWS, `Snapshot` snapshots then deletes (`--skip-final-snapshot` opts out of the snapshot). Each handled failed op is stripped from the journal segment immediately (per-op), so a later completed-op failure that keeps the segment for a re-run only re-attempts what is genuinely outstanding — never a revert that already succeeded. |
| `--skip-final-snapshot` | Delete a rolled-back CREATE (completed, or failed in-flight under `--revert-failed`) whose `DeletionPolicy` is `Snapshot` WITHOUT the final snapshot the policy promises (DATA LOSS — explicit opt-out of CloudFormation parity). By default the rollback creates the snapshot first, and refuses the delete for a shape it cannot snapshot; see [`DeletionPolicy: Snapshot`](#deletionpolicy-snapshot-final-snapshots-on-delete---skip-final-snapshot). Issue [#1358](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1358). |
| `--stack-region <region>` | Disambiguate when the same stack name has state in multiple regions (same UX as the `state` subcommands). |
| `--role-arn <arn>` | Assume-role before touching AWS. If the journal recorded a role and the flag is not passed, an informational note is printed. |
| `--state-bucket <bucket>` | Same resolution as other commands. |
| `--verbose` | Standard debug logging. |

**Flow**: resolve the stack + region → acquire the stack lock (a concurrent
deploy holding it fails the command with the standard lock error;
`cdkd force-unlock` applies) → print a per-segment plan → confirm (skipped by
`--force`) → replay segments newest-first, saving state after each op and
popping each segment when it finishes cleanly → if the oldest replayed
segment was the stack's first-ever deploy and state is now empty, delete
`state.json` too. Replay is idempotent: re-running after a partial rollback
skips resources already reverted.

**Exit codes**: `0` = fully clean (journal deleted); `2` = partial (one or
more ops failed best-effort, or were skipped with a warning — the journal is
kept so you can re-run); `1` = hard error (no journal, lock held,
credentials, etc.).

**Known limitations** (surfaced in the plan, not silent):

- A resource that was **DELETED** during the deploy cannot be restored (same
  as CloudFormation). Deletes run after creates/updates, so a typical
  mid-deploy failure has not deleted anything yet.
- The resource whose operation **failed** is left as-is by default. The
  journal records the failed op (its pre-op state + the attempted
  properties), and `--revert-failed` opts in to reverting it (issue
  [#1198](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1198)) — opt-in because the
  failed resource's remote state is genuinely unknown. A failed CREATE that
  recorded no physical id still cannot be acted on (skipped with a warning).
  Note: after a **clean automatic** rollback the journal is settled to a
  **failed-only** segment (`operations: []` plus the failed op records —
  issue [#1208](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1208)): the completed
  ops are already reverted, but the failed resource's record is kept so
  `cdkd rollback --revert-failed` works in the DEFAULT deploy flow too. A
  plain `cdkd rollback` on such a journal is a no-op replay that clears it;
  the next successful deploy also deletes it.
- **Replacements** are reverted by **reversing the replacement** (issue
  [#1199](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1199)): the old resource is
  re-CREATEd from its journaled pre-deploy state and the new resource is
  deleted (create-first; a user-supplied physical name still held by the new
  resource falls back to delete-new-first with a bounded name-release retry).
  Under `UpdateReplacePolicy: Retain` the orphaned old resource still exists,
  so it is simply re-adopted after the new one is deleted — a true clean
  revert. **Data caveat:** for a stateful type (DynamoDB / RDS / S3 / etc.)
  the old resource's data was destroyed by the replacement and cannot be
  recovered — the re-created resource starts empty (warned loudly in the
  replay; the plan labels these "reverse-replace").
- Reverts that reference old **asset objects** (e.g. Lambda `Code.S3Key`)
  need those objects to still exist — relevant to `cdkd gc` retention.
- The rolled-back COMPLETED CREATE's **`DeletionPolicy`** governs its delete,
  matching CloudFormation: `Retain` leaves the resource in AWS and drops it
  from state (the plan labels it `orphan`); `Snapshot` takes the final
  snapshot and THEN deletes, refusing (as a per-op failure, journal kept) any
  shape cdkd cannot snapshot unless `--skip-final-snapshot` is passed (issue
  [#1358](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1358)). The plan preview says
  which of the two will happen BEFORE you confirm — a shape cdkd cannot
  snapshot on the route the delete will take is labelled
  `cdkd cannot snapshot this resource; the rollback will REFUSE it` rather
  than promising a final snapshot (issue
  [#1366](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1366)); `RetainExceptOnCreate`
  and the default `Delete` delete plainly. `--revert-failed`'s delete of a
  resource whose CREATE FAILED mid-flight applies the SAME matrix since issue
  [#1362](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1362) — it acts only on a
  failed CREATE that AWS did provision (recorded physical id + matching state
  record), so `Retain` no longer deletes what the policy says to keep and
  `Snapshot` no longer destroys the data un-snapshotted.
- A re-run after a snapshot succeeded but its delete failed re-snapshots the
  name-keyed types (Redshift / ElastiCache), which only resume an IN-FLIGHT
  snapshot; EBS volumes are reused via the `cdkd:final-snapshot-of` tag. The
  rollback replay is the flow most likely to be re-run, so expect a second
  snapshot charge on those two types.

`cdkd export` refuses (with a confirmation gate) to hand a stack over to
CloudFormation while a rollback journal exists — the half-deployed state is
almost certainly not what you want exported; roll back or re-deploy first.

## Exit codes

cdkd commands distinguish three outcomes via the process exit code so
CI / bench scripts can react without grepping log output:

| Exit | Meaning | Emitted by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0` | Success — command completed and no resources are in an error state | All commands |
| `1` | Command-level failure — auth error, bad arguments, synth crash, unhandled exception. **`cdkd drift` also exits `1` when drift is detected**, and **`cdkd diff --fail` exits `1` when any change is detected** (the operative meaning is "non-zero outcome", not "command crashed") | All commands (default for any thrown error) |
| `2` | **Partial failure** — work completed but one or more resources failed, was SKIPPED, or was only partially COMPARED; state.json is preserved and re-running typically resolves it | `cdkd destroy`, `cdkd state destroy` (per-resource delete failures, and per-resource **skips** — issue #1752), `cdkd deploy` (resources left UNADDRESSED — a skipped DELETE or a replacement's surviving predecessor; issue [#1960](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1960), suppressible with `--allow-unaddressed`), `cdkd publish-assets` (per-stack asset publish failures), `cdkd rollback` (per-op failures / skipped-with-warning ops; the journal is kept for re-run), `cdkd drift` (nothing drifted, but cdkd REFUSED to compare a secret-bearing property — issue [#2108](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/2108); re-running does not clear it, but spelling the reference as a full ARN does — see the drift section) |

The implementation hangs off a `PartialFailureError` class in
`src/utils/error-handler.ts`. `handleError` reads the error's
`exitCode` property (defaults to 2 for `PartialFailureError`), so
callers cannot accidentally collapse the partial-failure case into the
general `1` bucket by re-throwing through `withErrorHandling`.

When exit `2` is emitted, the per-stack summary line in the run log
also switches glyphs:

```text
✓ Stack X destroyed (N deleted, 0 errors)                       # exit 0
⚠ Stack X partially destroyed (N deleted, M errors). State preserved — re-run 'cdkd destroy' / 'cdkd state destroy' to clean up.   # exit 2
⚠ Stack X partially destroyed (N deleted, S skipped, 0 errors). cdkd could not address the skipped resource(s) ...   # exit 2
```

`cdkd deploy` switches the same way (issue #1960) — a run that left a resource
unaddressed no longer claims to have completed successfully:

```text
✓ Deployment completed successfully                                                  # exit 0
⚠ Stack X deployed, but N resource(s) were left unaddressed — they may still exist in AWS. This counts toward a non-zero exit (2 unless something else fails; pass --allow-unaddressed to exit 0).   # exit 2
⚠ Stack X deployed, but N resource(s) were left unaddressed — they may still exist in AWS. Exiting 0 because --allow-unaddressed was passed.               # exit 0
```

Note the second line does not promise exit `2`: in a multi-stack run a later
stack can still FAIL, and a real failure takes precedence with exit `1`.

The warning is printed in both cases where a resource survived — the second and
third lines above; only the exit code differs between them. See [`--allow-unaddressed` (deploy)](#--allow-unaddressed-deploy)
for which two cases produce it and how they differ in recoverability.

### Skipped resources on destroy (issue #1752)

A **skipped** resource is one cdkd could not ADDRESS, so it may still exist
and still be billing. Three causes today:

- a state record whose composite `physicalId` does not decode
  (`AWS::Glue::Table`, `AWS::AppSync::{DataSource,Resolver,ApiKey}`,
  `AWS::EC2::NetworkAclEntry`) — no AWS call is issued at all, and the
  per-resource warning names the expected format;
- a state record missing the id or the property the delete call is addressed
  BY, in EVERY source cdkd can read it from (issue
  [#1770](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1770)) — also no AWS call at
  all. A malformed `AWS::Lambda::LayerVersion` version ARN (the layer version
  stays published); an `AWS::Lambda::Permission` with neither a `FunctionName`
  property nor a function ARN in its physicalId (the statement stays on the
  function's resource policy, i.e. an invoke grant outliving the stack); a
  Custom Resource with no properties or no `ServiceToken` (its handler never
  receives a `Delete` request, so whatever it manages elsewhere is untouched);
  an `AWS::Lambda::Permission` whose physicalId carries no StatementId; an
  `AWS::IAM::Policy` with neither a policy name in its physicalId nor a
  `PolicyName` property, or one naming no `Roles` / `Groups` / `Users` at all
  (an inline policy exists only as an attachment, so a record naming no
  principal cannot be deleted — the policy stays ATTACHED wherever it is); an
  `AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition` missing `GroupName` or
  `Users` (the users keep every permission the group grants). Each warning
  names what survived and how to repair it. Where the resource's PARENT is
  part of the same destroy — the Lambda function, the IAM role / group / user
  — that parent's own delete removes the skipped resource anyway, so AWS ends
  clean and only the cdkd record is stale; the warning says so, and
  `cdkd state orphan <stack>` clears it;
- a **nested stack** (`AWS::CloudFormation::Stack`) whose own destroy skipped
  a resource or was interrupted. Here the child's *other* resources were
  deleted first, so "skipped" means the child stack as a whole was not
  destroyed — not that nothing happened. The record to repair lives in the
  child's state file (`<parent>~<childLogicalId>`), which the summary names.

It is deliberately distinct from the neighbouring outcomes:

| | AWS resource | cdkd state record | Counts as |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| deleted | gone | dropped | `N deleted` |
| retained (`DeletionPolicy: Retain`) | kept **on purpose** | dropped | `N retained` |
| **skipped** | **may still exist** | **KEPT** | `N skipped`, exit `2` |
| failed | may still exist | kept | `N errors`, exit `2` |

The state record is kept on purpose: without it you would have neither
the AWS resource deleted nor an id to go and delete it with. To finish
the destroy, repair whatever the per-resource warning names — the
`physicalId` for the decode failures, the missing property (`FunctionName`,
`ServiceToken`, `GroupName` / `Users`) for the #1770 causes — in state
(`cdkd state show <stack>` to inspect) and re-run, or delete the resource by
hand and drop the record with `cdkd state orphan <stack>`. The summary line names the exact
state file(s) to open, which for a nested-stack skip is the child's.

#### A skip on `cdkd deploy`, not just on destroy (issue #1762)

The same provider outcome reaches `cdkd deploy`, which issues a DELETE for
every resource removed from the template plus one for the old resource of a
replacement. Each site handles it in the way that resource's situation allows:

| Deploy-side site | On a skip |
| --- | --- |
| a resource removed from the template | warns, prints `⚠ <id> (<type>) skipped (<reason>)`, **keeps the state record**, and counts it under `Skipped (not deleted)` in the summary. Because the record is kept, the resource is still a pending DELETE and the next `cdkd deploy` re-attempts it — but the run exits `2` (issue #1960), since the template as written was not applied |
| the old resource of a replacement (`--replace`, `--recreate-via-*`, an UPDATE the type does not support in place) | **fails the resource** — the replacement create would otherwise run beside a live old one, or collide with its name |
| the cleanup delete after a create-first replacement | warns; the new resource is already created and recorded, so the old one is untracked whether the delete failed or was skipped. Delete it by hand |
| a rollback delete (automatic, or `cdkd rollback`) | counted as a per-op **failure** at four of the five arms, so the journal segment is kept and re-running `cdkd rollback` re-attempts it. The exception is the delete of the NEW resource AFTER the old one was re-created: that arm's delete is already best-effort (the revert itself succeeded and state points at the old resource), so a skip warns and counts as a warning — the new resource is left untracked and must be deleted by hand |

A deploy-side skip changes the exit code too, since issue
[#1960](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1960). This reverses the earlier
rule recorded here — that a skip on deploy stayed exit `0` because a kept record
means the next run heals it, while `cdkd destroy` has no next run. Self-healing
is still the real difference between the two verbs, and the table above keeps
it; what it does not justify is reporting SUCCESS in the meantime. The deploy
did not apply the template it was given, and a pipeline reading only the exit
code was being told it had. `--allow-unaddressed` restores exit `0` for callers
who accept that (see [`--allow-unaddressed` (deploy)](#--allow-unaddressed-deploy)).

#### A nested stack whose child FAILED is an error, not a skip (issue #1777)

The third outcome a child stack's destroy can report is a resource that was
ATTEMPTED and FAILED. That is **not** a skip — a skip asserts no AWS call was
issued — so the parent's `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack` row FAILS, exactly as a
failed delete of any other resource type does:

```text
✗ Failed to delete Child: Nested stack MyStack~Child failed to destroy: 1 resource(s) failed to delete.
  The child's state is PRESERVED and still lists them — inspect it with 'cdkd state show MyStack~Child',
  resolve the failure, and re-run the destroy. ...

⚠ Stack MyStack partially destroyed (2 deleted, 1 errors). State preserved ...   # exit 2
```

Before this change the parent swallowed the child's error count: it printed
`✓ Child (AWS::CloudFormation::Stack) deleted`, dropped the child's row, and —
because the parent itself had recorded no errors — deleted the parent's
`state.json` and its exports-index entries and exited **0**, while the child's
own `state.json` sat preserved describing live, billing resources that nothing
named any more. If you scripted around the old exit code, note that this
destroy now exits 2.

**`cdkd deploy` is affected too.** Removing an `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack`
from your template routes that row through the deploy engine's DELETE path, so
a child that fails to destroy now **fails the deploy** (and its siblings roll
back) where it previously recorded the row as deleted and carried on. Same
correctness argument, wider blast radius: verify a nested stack destroys
cleanly before removing it from the template.

The remedy the summary prints names the CHILD's state file
(`cdkd state orphan <parent>~<child>`), not the parent's — the resource that
failed lives in the child, and orphaning the parent would drop the very row
that keeps the child reachable. A run that has BOTH failures and skips prints
each remedy separately, since they are different in kind: a failure is
retryable (`cdkd destroy` again), while a skip needs its state record repaired
first.

The run-level exit message counts **entries**, not resources: a skipped
nested-stack row is one entry however many of the child's own resources it
covers. The per-stack summary lines above it give the exact breakdown.

If your bench / CI script previously treated any non-zero from `cdkd
destroy` as a hard failure (because it never had a non-zero outcome
before), you may now want to branch on `2` separately to schedule a
retry instead of paging.

## `cdkd export` (hand a stack over to CloudFormation)

`cdkd export <stack>` is the mirror of `cdkd import` (AWS → cdkd) in
the reverse direction (cdkd → CloudFormation). It builds a CFn
`ChangeSetType=IMPORT` changeset from cdkd state + the synthesized
template, executes it, and deletes cdkd state on success. AWS resources
are unchanged across the migration.

```bash
cdkd export MyStack                              # confirmation prompt; CFn stack name = cdkd stack name
cdkd export MyStack --cfn-stack-name MyStack-CFn
cdkd export MyStack --dry-run                    # print the import plan, no CFn calls
cdkd export MyStack --template path.json         # pre-rendered template (JSON or YAML — format auto-detected, skip synth)
cdkd export                                       # auto-detect single-stack apps
```

**Flow**:

1. Synthesize the CDK app (or read `--template <path>`) to get the
   CloudFormation template.
2. Load cdkd state for the target stack; build the
   `(logicalId, physicalId, resourceType)` map.
3. Refuse if a CFn stack with the destination name already exists, or
   if any template resource is in the **blocked** set (template
   resources without a cdkd state entry; or `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack`
   rows whose parent cdkd state has no matching nested-stack entry). Lambda-backed Custom Resources (`Custom::*` AND
   `AWS::CloudFormation::CustomResource` — the latter is what
   `new cdk.CustomResource(...)` synthesizes when no `resourceType` is
   passed) are NOT blocked but require `--include-non-importable` to
   run the 2-phase flow described below. `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack`
   rows whose parent state has a matching nested-stack entry are
   classified into a dedicated `nestedStackRows` list and exported via
   the **per-stack IMPORT loop** (issue
   [#464](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/464) PR B2): the
   orchestrator recursively walks the cdkd state tree via
   `buildCdkdStateStackTree` and submits IMPORT changesets per
   cdkd-managed stack in leaf-first order. Leaf stacks get a single
   CREATE-via-IMPORT changeset; non-leaf parents get two per parent
   (Phase 1A CREATE-via-IMPORT for the parent's leaf resources only,
   then Phase 1B UPDATE-via-IMPORT against the now-existing parent to
   adopt the already-IMPORTed children via the AWS-docs "Nest an
   existing stack" pattern). Phase 1B injects
   `DeletionPolicy: Retain` plus
   `ResourceIdentifier: { StackId: <child arn> }` plus a `TemplateURL`
   rewritten to point at the child's AWS-canonicalized template
   fetched via `GetTemplate(Processed)` post-IMPORT plus child Tags
   forwarded from `DescribeStacks` (AWS's "Nested stack import
   validation" rejects tag mismatches). Between phases each non-root
   stack is flipped from `IMPORT_COMPLETE` to `UPDATE_COMPLETE` via a
   no-op tag-only `UpdateStack` (AWS rejects `IMPORT_COMPLETE` as a
   non-importable status for nesting; the flip adds a transient
   `cdkd:nested-export-flip` tag that Phase 1B then forwards verbatim
   into the parent template). Each
   child cdkd stack `<parent>~<childLogicalId>` becomes its own CFn
   stack named `<parent>-<childLogicalId>` by default (`~` is illegal
   in CFn stack names); per-child overrides via
   `--cfn-child-stack-name '<cdkdName>=<cfnName>'` (repeatable).
   Per-child Parameters are forwarded from the parent template's
   `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack.Properties.Parameters` block — literal
   string / number / boolean values pass through, and intrinsic-valued
   Parameters (`{Ref: <ParentParam>}` / `{Fn::GetAtt: [ParentResource,
   Attr]}`) are resolved at IMPORT time against the parent's resolved
   Parameters + cdkd state (a root-first pre-pass, since a child's
   Parameters resolve against its parent's). A value cdkd cannot resolve
   degrades to a warning and the child template's Parameter `Default`
   must cover it. The original "one atomic `--include-nested-stacks` IMPORT
   changeset" design was found infeasible by the 2026-05-24 AWS spike —
   AWS rejects that flag combination with
   `ValidationError: IncludeNestedStacks is not supported for changeSet type: IMPORT`;
   see [docs/design/464-nested-stacks-export-import.md](design/464-nested-stacks-export-import.md)
   §4.0 / §4.3 for the per-stack-loop algorithm. `--dry-run` prints
   the per-stack plan summary without acquiring child locks or
   submitting any changeset.
4. Resolve each resource type's primary identifier property name(s) via
   `cloudformation:DescribeType` (with a hardcoded fallback table for
   ~30 single-key types). **Composite primary identifiers**
   (`primaryIdentifier.length > 1`) are supported for
   `AWS::ApiGateway::Method`, `AWS::ApiGateway::Resource`,
   `AWS::ApiGateway::Deployment`, `AWS::ApiGateway::Stage`,
   `AWS::ApiGateway::Authorizer`, `AWS::ApiGateway::Model`,
   `AWS::ApiGateway::RequestValidator`,
   `AWS::EC2::VPCGatewayAttachment`, `AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Integration`,
   `AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Route`, `AWS::S3Tables::Namespace`, and
   `AWS::Lambda::Permission` via a
   per-type splitter that maps cdkd's `physicalId` (plus the resource's
   recorded `properties` for sub-resource types where the parent
   identifier — `ApiId` / `FunctionName` — lives in `properties`, not
   in `physicalId`) to the field map `ResourceIdentifier` expects.
   Sub-resource types whose primaryIdentifier includes an AWS-generated
   id (`IntegrationId` / `RouteId` / Lambda::Permission's `Id`) narrow
   the `Properties` overlay to the writable subset so CFn doesn't reject
   the changeset with "Encountered unsupported property". Other composite
   types abort with a clear error pointing at where to register a new
   splitter in `src/cli/commands/export.ts`. **IMPORT-unsupported
   types** (CFn schema lacks the handlers needed for IMPORT lookup —
   either `handlers: []` outright, or no `read` / `list` handler so CFn
   can't look the resource up by identifier) are auto-handled via a
   pre-delete + phase-2-CREATE dance: cdkd skips the resource from
   phase 1, deletes the AWS-side resource between phases via the
   appropriate SDK call, and lets CFn re-CREATE in phase 2.
   Currently registered:
   - `AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Stage` (`handlers: []`; auto-emitted by CDK's
     `HttpApi` construct as `$default`; pre-delete via
     `apigatewayv2:DeleteStage`). Brief unavailability window ~10s;
     HttpApi endpoint URL is unchanged because it embeds ApiId, not
     StageName.
   - `AWS::IAM::Policy` (`handlers: ['create', 'delete', 'update']` — no
     `read` / `list` because inline policy attachments have no
     first-class AWS resource id; auto-emitted by CDK L2 grants such as
     ECS Task Execution Role ECR pull policy and Lambda execution role
     inline policies; pre-delete via `iam:DeleteRolePolicy` /
     `DeleteUserPolicy` / `DeleteGroupPolicy` per attachment target).
     The inline policy attachment is dropped from each Role / User /
     Group between phases — any in-flight AWS API call that depends on
     the granted permission will fail with `AccessDenied` until CFn
     re-CREATEs in phase 2.

   Pass `--no-recreate-import-unsupported` to block instead of
   auto-handling. Per-type config lives in `IMPORT_UNSUPPORTED_RECREATABLE_TYPES`
   and `PRE_DELETE_HANDLERS` in `src/cli/commands/export.ts`.

   **Types whose cdkd physical id is composite while the CFn identifier
   is a single field** are resolved from the value cdkd RECORDED, not
   from the id (issue
   [#1659](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1659)). CFn identifies
   an `AWS::S3Tables::Table` by its `TableARN` and an
   `AWS::AppSync::DataSource` / `::Resolver` by its `DataSourceArn` /
   `ResolverArn`, while cdkd's physical id for each is the
   pipe-joined tuple its provider needs
   (`<tableBucketARN>|<namespace>|<name>`, `<apiId>|<name>`,
   `<apiId>|<typeName>|<fieldName>`) — and the correct identifier is
   not a segment of that tuple, so the composite-id splitters above
   cannot produce it. cdkd reads the ARN from the resource's recorded
   `attributes` instead, and blocks the resource with an actionable
   message when state does not carry it (a record written before cdkd
   started recording the ARN — re-deploy the stack once to heal it, as
   [state-management.md](state-management.md#the-composite-id-is-not-what-ref-returns)
   describes). `AWS::EC2::SecurityGroupIngress` is the fourth member and
   works the same way: CFn identifies a rule by the `sgr-...` id AWS
   mints, which cdkd records as the rule's `Id` attribute (issue
   [#1761](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1761)) while its
   physical id stays the `<groupId>|<ipProtocol>|<fromPort>|<toPort>`
   tuple the revoke path needs. Its remedies differ from the other
   three, because there are two ways to lack the attribute. A rule
   declaring **more than one source** (both `CidrIp` and `CidrIpv6` on
   one resource) makes AWS mint one rule per source, and cdkd records
   neither id — neither is "the" identifier — so re-deploying never
   heals it; split it into one ingress resource per source. A rule
   simply **older than #1761** carries no `Id` at all, and a *no-op*
   re-deploy does not heal that one either, since AWS returns the rule
   id only from `AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress` itself. **`cdkd export`
   recovers it for you** (issue
   [#1791](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1791)): a row with no
   usable recorded `Id` triggers a paginated
   `DescribeSecurityGroupRules` on the group the physical id names, and
   the rule is adopted only when EXACTLY ONE ingress rule on that group
   carries the composite's `(protocol, port range)` tuple. Zero matches
   is REFUSED naming the row and the tuple cdkd searched for — nothing
   matched, so there are no candidates to name; more than one is
   REFUSED naming the row and every candidate `sgr-…` id, since two
   rules sharing that tuple are two rules cdkd's own physical id
   cannot tell apart either. Matching rules are counted BEFORE any is
   set aside, so a rule AWS reports without a usable `sgr-…` id refuses
   too rather than letting its sibling pass as "exactly one" — and when
   more than one rule matched, that refusal carries the two-cause
   remedy below as well. "More than one" has two causes: the
   multi-source rule above (split the resource), and two DISTINCT
   ingress resources differing only by SOURCE, which the composite
   carries none of — those are already one resource per source, so
   repair the row's `attributes.Id` or remove the row before
   exporting. The lookup needs `ec2:DescribeSecurityGroupRules`;
   without that permission the row is blocked with a message saying
   so, while a THROTTLED lookup is retried with backoff and reported
   as a throttle, not as a missing permission. A row whose state
   already records the `Id` — everything a current cdkd deploys —
   issues no live read at all.

   **Types CloudFormation cannot IMPORT at all are refused up front.**
   A type whose registry schema declares no `read` handler AND reports
   `ProvisioningType: NON_PROVISIONABLE` is rejected by
   `CreateChangeSet` with
   `ResourceTypes [<T>] are not supported for Import` — `AWS::Glue::Table`,
   `AWS::Route53::RecordSet`, `AWS::Route53::RecordSetGroup`,
   `AWS::AppSync::ApiKey`, `AWS::EC2::NetworkAclEntry`,
   `AWS::SQS::QueuePolicy` and `AWS::SNS::TopicPolicy` are all in this
   class (measured live, us-east-1, 2026-08-13). cdkd surfaces them
   from the schema it already fetches for the identifier and names
   EVERY offending resource in one message — AWS's own error is not
   exhaustive (a probe carrying three unsupported types named two of
   them). Both signals must agree before cdkd refuses, so a partial or
   unusual `DescribeType` response falls back to letting AWS answer.

   The whole plan — this refusal and every other `blocked` reason — is
   built BEFORE the stack lock is acquired, so a stack that cannot be
   exported says so without first locking out concurrent `cdkd deploy`
   / `cdkd destroy`. Planning issues no AWS write (it reads cdkd state
   and `DescribeType`), and the nested-stack path has always planned
   before locking.

   Remove the resource from the stack before exporting (it stays in AWS
   and can be re-declared in CloudFormation afterwards), or destroy it
   first and let CloudFormation create it fresh. The verdict is a
   registry HEURISTIC rather than AWS's published supported-for-import
   list, so `--skip-import-support-preflight` is the escape hatch if
   AWS has since made the type importable — the changeset is then
   submitted and CloudFormation answers for itself.
5. Acquire the stack lock so concurrent `cdkd deploy` cannot race.
6. Confirm with the user (skipped with `-y` / `--yes`).
7. **Preprocess the phase-1 template** (automatic; required by CFn IMPORT
   contract):
   - **Strip Outputs entirely.** CFn rejects IMPORT changesets that
     declare ANY Outputs with "you cannot modify or add [Outputs]".
     Phase 2 UPDATE re-submits the full synth template and restores
     Outputs along with the non-importable resources.
   - **Inject `DeletionPolicy: Delete`** on resources that lack the
     attribute. CFn IMPORT requires `DeletionPolicy` on every imported
     resource, and CDK synth only emits it when `RemovalPolicy` is
     explicitly set. cdkd injects `Delete` (not `Retain`) so the
     post-export CFn template matches the CFn type-default — same as
     what plain CFn would have applied for a resource without explicit
     `RemovalPolicy`. The user sees no surprising `Retain` attribute
     and the post-export `cdk diff` has no DeletionPolicy noise.
     `UpdateReplacePolicy` is intentionally NOT injected (only
     `DeletionPolicy` is required for IMPORT).
   - **Conditional overlay of `ResourceIdentifier` onto `Properties`.**
     Mirrors upstream `cdk import` behavior: pass the synth template
     through and let CFn match resources via
     `ResourcesToImport[].ResourceIdentifier` (the changeset API
     parameter) alone, except when the synth template carries a
     *literal* value for the field that *differs* from
     `ResourceIdentifier`. Four cases:
     - **Absent** (auto-generated names — user did NOT declare a
       physical name in CDK code): `Properties[<NameField>]` stays
       absent. CFn accepts the IMPORT changeset using
       `ResourceIdentifier` alone (verified against AWS in upstream
       `cdk import`). Post-export `cdk diff` is clean because both
       CFn-managed template and CDK synth have the property absent.
     - **Intrinsic** (composite-id sub-resources whose synth references
       the parent via `{Ref: ...}` / `{Fn::GetAtt: ...}` — Integration /
       Route / Lambda::Permission / API Gateway Method etc.): the
       intrinsic is preserved. CFn resolves it during changeset
       processing against the parent's own `ResourceIdentifier` (the
       parent is imported in the same changeset), so the resolved value
       equals `ResourceIdentifier[<field>]` and CFn accepts. Post-export
       `cdk diff` stays clean (both sides keep the intrinsic shape).
     - **Literal-mismatch** (pre-v0.94.0 prefix-on-user-declared-name
       legacy: user wrote `roleName: 'foo'` in CDK code; cdkd's deploy
       prefixed it to `'CdkSampleStack-foo'` on AWS): override
       `Properties.RoleName` from the unprefixed CDK value to the
       prefixed AWS value. CFn's identifier-match check requires this
       — otherwise AWS rejects with `The Identifier [<Field>] for
       resource [...] does not match the identifier value for the
       resource in the template`. The overlay persists into the
       post-import CFn template; the next `cdk deploy` proposes
       REPLACE — same caveat as upstream `cdk import` with
       mismatched-name CDK code (see the "Replacement risk on next
       deploy" caveat below). The prefix-migration pre-flight (PR #300)
       is meant to surface this before export. v0.94.0+ stacks with the
       default `--no-prefix-user-supplied-names` flip are NOT in this
       case — `Properties.RoleName` matches the AWS name without
       override.
     - **Unrepresentable** (a list carrying an intrinsic, a nested
       list, or an empty list): the export REFUSES, naming the
       resource, the property and the scalar to declare instead. Issue
       [#1787](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1787) widened
       "literal" past `typeof === 'string'` for the three cases above,
       because a field the template carries as an ARRAY is neither
       absent nor an intrinsic and used to survive into the phase-1
       template, where CFn answered with an opaque rejection — reachable
       via `addPropertyOverride('Namespace', ['analytics'])` on
       `AWS::S3Tables::Namespace`, which cdkd deploys because the
       provider accepts both wire shapes. A plain literal (string,
       number, boolean, or an array of those) is now OVERWRITTEN with
       the scalar identifier, which is not a guess: the overlay value
       comes from the cdkd-recorded physicalId, the authority on what
       the resource IS. Only the shapes above are refused, because
       preserving any of them reproduces the opaque rejection, while what
       makes overwriting wrong differs per shape — only a list that
       actually carries an object element has an intrinsic to discard, so
       the message says which reason applies.

     Closes [issue #319]: pre-v0.95 cdkd unconditionally injected
     `ResourceIdentifier` values into `Properties` even when the synth
     had no value for that field, baking cdkd-prefixed auto-gen names
     AND composite-id literals into the post-export CFn template →
     post-export `cdk diff` proposed REPLACE on every auto-named
     resource and every composite-id sub-resource (defeating the
     migration's "AWS resources unchanged" promise). v0.95+ overlay is
     conditional; only the literal-mismatch legacy case still carries
     the documented post-export caveat.
8. `CreateChangeSet --change-set-type IMPORT` → wait → `ExecuteChangeSet`
   → `waitUntilStackImportComplete`. On failure cdkd fetches
   `DescribeStackEvents` and surfaces the per-resource failure reasons
   (the waiter alone only reports the high-level rollback state).
9. Delete cdkd state for the migrated stack.
10. Release lock.

**MVP scope** (intentional cuts; lift in follow-up PRs):

- **JSON and YAML templates supported.** Both formats round-trip through
  cdkd's CFn-aware codec (`src/cli/yaml-cfn.ts`), which preserves every
  CFn shorthand intrinsic (`!Ref`, `!Sub`, `!GetAtt`, `!Join`, …) across
  the parse → preprocess → re-serialize cycle. The phase-1 IMPORT and
  phase-2 UPDATE changesets emit in the same format as the source
  template — a YAML-authored CFn stack stays YAML on the wire.
- **Cross-stack consumer scan** runs at synth time when other stacks in
  the same CDK app reference the exporting stack via
  `Fn::GetStackOutput`. Since issue
  [#1697](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1697) those consumers
  keep resolving after the migration via the CloudFormation fallback
  (weak reference), so by default cdkd warns that the references become
  fallback-dependent (they break only for consumers deployed with
  `--no-cfn-fallback`); `--strict-cross-stack` refuses instead. Without
  `Fn::GetStackOutput` (or with consumer stacks outside the CDK app), no
  scan can run and the user is responsible for the check.
- **Drift baseline pre-flight** surfaces a warning when cdkd state lacks
  `observedProperties` for one or more resources. Without that baseline
  `cdkd drift` cannot reliably compare against AWS, so the next
  `cdk deploy` post-migration may surface unexpected changes if AWS has
  drifted from the synth template. Resolve by running
  `cdkd state refresh-observed <stack>` (or any redeploy) before
  exporting, then `cdkd drift <stack>` to verify. Non-blocking by
  design — the user decides whether to proceed.
- **Template Parameters** in the synthesized template are forwarded to
  both phase-1 and phase-2 changesets. Each parameter is resolved in
  order: (1) `--parameter Key=Value` CLI override (repeatable), then
  (2) the template's `Default`. A parameter with neither override nor
  default aborts with a clear error listing which keys are missing.
  A `--parameter` override for a key the template does not declare is
  also rejected (catches typos). CDK-generated templates typically only
  carry `BootstrapVersion` with a default; `cdkd export` works without
  any `--parameter` for those.
- **Lambda-backed Custom Resources** (`Custom::*` AND
  `AWS::CloudFormation::CustomResource`) require `--include-non-importable`
  to opt into the 2-phase flow: phase 1 IMPORT changeset for the
  importable resources, then phase 2 UPDATE changeset for the full
  template — CFn CREATEs the Custom Resources, which re-invokes each
  backing Lambda's onCreate handler. The handler must be (1) idempotent
  (same `PhysicalResourceId` / `Data` on every event type) AND
  (2) correctly do the cfn-response protocol (PUT a Status/PhysicalResourceId
  payload to `event.ResponseURL`). cdkd's deploy path also accepts a
  return-value fast path for handler responses, but CFn-side phase-2
  UPDATE / future rollback / future `cdk deploy` against the imported
  stack all require the actual ResponseURL POST — a CR backed by a
  return-only Lambda will time out at the CFn 1-hour Custom Resource
  ceiling. Without the flag, the CR types in the template cause the
  command to abort. `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack` (nested stacks) is
  fully supported as of issue [#464](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/464)
  PR B2: the dedicated branch + `buildCdkdStateStackTree` walker
  recursively loads every child state file, validates the tree shape,
  and `runPerStackImportLoop` submits one IMPORT changeset per
  cdkd-managed stack in the tree in leaf-first order. Non-leaf parents
  adopt their just-imported children via the AWS-docs "Nest an
  existing stack" pattern (the original
  `--include-nested-stacks` design was found infeasible by the
  2026-05-24 AWS spike — see [design/464-nested-stacks-export-import.md](design/464-nested-stacks-export-import.md)
  §4.0 / §4.3 for the per-stack-loop algorithm). On per-stack failure,
  cdkd state for the failed stack and every yet-to-be-imported stack
  is preserved; the error message names which stacks moved and which
  remain so the user can re-run `cdkd export <parent>` after fixing
  the underlying cause (already-imported children will be re-adopted
  as nested references on retry). On phase-2 failure, cdkd state is
  preserved and the error message includes the recovery procedure
  (`aws cloudformation create-change-set --change-set-type UPDATE ...`
  followed by `cdkd state orphan`).
- **Inline `TemplateBody` only** (51,200-byte cap). Templates larger than
  that require S3 upload via `TemplateURL`; not yet implemented.
- **Synth template used verbatim**: cdkd does NOT substitute `observedProperties`
  into the template. If the CDK code has drifted from the AWS-current state,
  the next `cdk deploy` after migration will update the resource. Run
  `cdkd drift` before exporting if drift matters.

**Context preservation (CLI `-c` is refused by default)**:

CDK reads context from `cdk.json` and `cdk.context.json` on every
synth. CLI `-c key=value` overrides are NOT persisted to either file
— they apply only to the current invocation. If you run `cdkd export
-c env=prod` and later run `cdk deploy` without the same `-c env=prod`,
CDK synthesizes a different template, which CFn sees as drift / a
replacement on the first post-migration deploy.

`cdkd export` refuses by default when CLI `-c` overrides are present.
Two ways forward:

- **Recommended**: move the overrides into `cdk.json`'s `"context": { ... }`
  field, then re-run `cdkd export` without `-c`. Subsequent `cdk deploy`
  invocations read `cdk.json` automatically.
- **Escape**: pass `--accept-transient-context`. cdkd proceeds and emits
  a warn that names every override. You are then responsible for passing
  the SAME `-c` flags to every future `cdk deploy` for this stack (or
  moving them to `cdk.json` before then). On success, cdkd prints the
  exact `cdk diff` / `cdk deploy` command including the captured flags.

**Caveats**:

- **Replacement risk on next deploy** (post-v0.95, only one residual
  case — closes [issue #319]):
  - **Pre-v0.94.0 prefix legacy** (`--prefix-user-supplied-names` opt-in,
    or stacks deployed before v0.94.0 flipped the default): cdkd's deploy
    prefixed user-declared physical names with the stack name for
    cross-stack uniqueness (e.g. `roleName: 'my-role'` became
    `MyStack-my-role` on AWS). The phase-1 IMPORT preprocessing rewrites
    the template's name field to the prefixed value (otherwise CFn
    IMPORT rejects the identifier mismatch), and this prefixed value
    persists into the post-import CFn template. The next `cdk deploy`
    will see `MyStack-my-role` (CFn-recorded) vs `my-role` (CDK-declared)
    as a property change on an immutable name field → REPLACEMENT.
    Before the first post-export deploy, either change the CDK code to
    the prefixed value (`roleName: 'MyStack-my-role'`) or accept the
    replacement. The prefix-migration pre-flight (PR #300 /
    `prefix-migration-check.ts`) is meant to surface this before export.

  **No longer in this category as of v0.95** (closes [issue #319]):
  - Auto-generated names (user did NOT declare `bucketName: '...'` etc.):
    cdkd's overlay used to bake the cdkd-prefixed name into the
    post-export CFn template, causing every auto-named resource to be
    proposed for REPLACE on next `cdk deploy`. Post-v0.95 the overlay is
    conditional and skipped for this case → post-export `cdk diff` is
    clean for auto-gen names.
  - Composite-id sub-resources (`AWS::ApiGateway::Method` /
    `AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Integration` / `AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Route` /
    `AWS::Lambda::Permission` etc.): cdkd's overlay used to overwrite
    `Properties.ApiId` (intrinsic `{Ref: ...}`) with the resolved literal
    parent id, causing every composite sub-resource to be proposed for
    REPLACE on next `cdk deploy`. Post-v0.95 intrinsics are preserved →
    post-export `cdk diff` is clean for composite sub-resources.

  When the legacy prefix case applies, check the post-import changeset
  (`aws cloudformation create-change-set --change-set-type UPDATE`) for
  surprises before executing your first post-export `cdk deploy`.
- **Cross-stack `Fn::GetStackOutput` consumers** in other cdkd stacks
  keep working after the export via the CloudFormation fallback (issue
  [#1697](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1697)): the exported
  stack's outputs move to CloudFormation, and the consumers' next
  resolve reads them from there (`DescribeStacks`) after the cdkd-state
  miss. The reference stays weak either way. Only when deploying
  consumers with `--no-cfn-fallback` does the pre-#1697 constraint
  return — plan multi-stack migrations from the leaves up in that case.

Exits `0` on success, `1` on any failure (changeset rejection, AWS
auth, lock contention, etc.). cdkd state is deleted only after the
import changeset completes successfully; a mid-flow failure leaves
cdkd state intact and the user can re-run the command.

## `publish-assets` (synth + build + publish, no deploy)

`cdkd publish-assets` runs the asset half of the deploy pipeline —
synthesize the CDK app, build any Docker images, upload file assets to
S3, push images to ECR — and then **stops**. No state writes, no
provisioning, no lock acquisition. This is the "CI builds and uploads
assets, a separate runner deploys" split that pipelines often want.

cdkd publish-assets                          # synth + publish all stacks (or auto-detect single stack)
cdkd publish-assets <stack> [<stack>...]     # synth + publish specific stack(s)
cdkd publish-assets --all                    # synth + publish every stack in the app
cdkd publish-assets 'My*'                    # wildcard
cdkd publish-assets -a cdk.out               # skip synth — read a pre-synthesized cloud assembly
```

Synthesizes the CDK app via the standard `--app` / `CDKD_APP` /
`cdk.json` chain, applies the same stack-name matching as
`deploy` / `diff` / `destroy` (positional arg routes by `/` to display
path or physical name; supports `*` wildcards), and feeds each selected
stack's asset manifest into the same `WorkGraph` pipeline that `deploy`
uses (with `stack: 0` concurrency so no stack-deploy nodes run).

`-a/--app` accepts either a shell command (`"node app.ts"`) or
a path to an already-synthesized cloud assembly directory (`cdk.out`);
when a directory is given, synthesis is skipped and the manifest is
read directly. Same dual semantics as `cdkd deploy`. Re-using a
pre-synthesized assembly is therefore covered by `-a <dir>` and
`publish-assets` does NOT have its own `--path <manifest>` flag.

Asset destinations follow the region's asset mode (issue
[#1002](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1002)): the command reads the
per-region bootstrap marker from the state bucket (resolved via the standard
`--state-bucket` / `CDKD_STATE_BUCKET` / `cdk.json` / default chain — the
command never writes state) and, when the region is opted in, publishes to
the cdkd-owned storage so a subsequent `cdkd deploy` finds the assets where
its rewritten templates point. When no state bucket is resolvable at all,
the command falls back to the manifest destinations verbatim with an info
line. `--use-cdk-bootstrap-assets` pins the legacy destinations explicitly.

Concurrency knobs (same defaults as `deploy`):

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--asset-publish-concurrency` | 8 | Maximum concurrent S3 uploads + ECR pushes |
| `--image-build-concurrency` | 4 | Maximum concurrent Docker image builds |

Exit codes:

- `0` — every selected stack's assets published cleanly.
- `1` — command-level failure (auth, synth crash, bad arguments).
- `2` — **partial failure**: one or more stacks failed but the rest
  published. Re-run to retry the failed stacks. Per-stack outcomes are
  listed in the run summary.

## `local *` (run AWS workloads locally)

The `cdkd local` command family runs AWS workloads on the developer's
machine — Lambda functions, API Gateway routes, ECS tasks, ECS
Services, ALB front-doors, CloudFront distributions, and Bedrock
AgentCore Runtimes — without an AWS deploy. Most commands run the
workload in Docker; `local start-cloudfront` serves a
CloudFront-Functions + S3-origin distribution in-process (no Docker),
falling back to Docker/RIE only for a Lambda Function URL origin. The
full reference for all `cdkd local *` subcommands (`local invoke` /
`local start-api` / `local run-task` / `local start-service` /
`local start-alb` / `local start-cloudfront` / `local invoke-agentcore` /
`local start-agentcore`) lives in
**[docs/local-emulation.md](local-emulation.md)**.

## `events` (read deployment-event history)

`cdkd events <stack>` reads back the structured deployment events cdkd
records for every `cdkd deploy` / `cdkd destroy` run — cdkd's local
equivalent of CloudFormation's `DescribeStackEvents`. Events are
persisted as JSONL under a `deployments/` key family separate from
`state.json` (no state schema bump), so a destroyed stack's failure
history stays readable. Event recording is best-effort and never blocks
the deploy / destroy; events carry error + metadata only (never resource
properties).

```bash
cdkd events MyStack                       # list runs, newest first
cdkd events MyStack --run <runId>         # one run's full event stream
cdkd events MyStack --format json         # machine-readable JSON (or --json)
cdkd events MyStack --stack-region <r>    # disambiguate multi-region history
```

### `events prune` (purge old event history)

The store self-bounds to the last 20 runs at write time, but `cdkd destroy`
deliberately keeps event history as post-mortem context, so it never returns
the bucket to empty on its own. `cdkd events prune <stack>` is the explicit
purge (issue [#885](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/885)):

```bash
cdkd events prune MyStack                 # keep the newest 20 (default)
cdkd events prune MyStack --keep 5        # keep the newest 5
cdkd events prune MyStack --older-than 24h# delete runs older than 24h
cdkd events prune MyStack --all           # purge everything (+ the index)
cdkd events prune MyStack --all --yes     # skip the confirmation (CI)
```

`--all` is mutually exclusive with `--keep` / `--older-than`. With both
`--keep` and `--older-than`, a run is deleted only when it is BOTH beyond the
newest-N window AND older than the cutoff. Prompts for confirmation unless
`-y` / `--yes`; `--stack-region` disambiguates a multi-region stack.

State-driven (no synth, no lock). See
**[docs/deployment-events.md](deployment-events.md)** for the full
reference: event types, S3 key layout, flush strategy, `index.json`
semantics, and the retention model.
