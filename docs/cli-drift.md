# cdkd drift

`cdkd drift` compares each resource cdkd manages against its live AWS-side
configuration and reports what diverged. Detection is the default; `--accept`
and `--revert` also resolve what the comparator finds, in either direction.
cdkd does not go through CloudFormation, so CloudFormation's own drift
detection does not apply — the comparison is state against a fresh read from
each resource's provider.

```bash
cdkd drift                              # the single stack in state
cdkd drift MyStack                      # one stack by name
cdkd drift --all                        # every stack in the state bucket
cdkd drift MyStack --stack-region us-east-1   # disambiguate a multi-region name
cdkd drift --all --json                 # machine-readable, for CI gating
cdkd drift MyStack --accept --yes       # state <- AWS (catch up to a console edit)
cdkd drift MyStack --revert --yes       # AWS <- state (undo a console edit)
cdkd drift MyStack --revert --dry-run   # preview either resolution
```

## Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[stacks...]` | — | Stack name(s) to check, as physical CloudFormation names. With none given and `--all` unset, the single stack in state is auto-selected. |
| `--all` | off | Check every stack in the state bucket. |
| `--json` | off | Emit the structured per-stack report on stdout, and nothing else. |
| `--accept` | off | Write the AWS-current values into cdkd state (state ← AWS). Mutually exclusive with `--revert`. |
| `--revert` | off | Push cdkd state values back into AWS (AWS ← state). Mutually exclusive with `--accept`. |
| `--dry-run` | off | Print the planned mutations and exit, without taking a lock or calling AWS / S3. |
| `--concurrency <n>` | `4` | Maximum concurrent `provider.update` calls during `--revert`. No effect on `--accept`, whose writes are serialized per stack. |
| `--stack-region <region>` | — | Region of the stack record to inspect. Required when one stack name has state in more than one region. |
| `-y`, `--yes` | off | Skip the confirmation prompt before `--accept` writes state or `--revert` writes to AWS. |
| `--state-bucket <bucket>` | `CDKD_STATE_BUCKET` / `cdk.json` | S3 bucket holding the state records. |
| `--state-prefix <prefix>` | `cdkd` | S3 key prefix for state files. |
| `--profile <profile>` | — | AWS profile. |
| `--role-arn <arn>` | `CDKD_ROLE_ARN` | IAM role to assume for AWS API calls. |
| `--verbose` | off | Verbose logging. |

`--region` is deprecated — prefer `AWS_REGION` or your AWS profile — but it is
still honored if passed, and it is not a no-op.

`cdkd drift` reads state only. It never synthesizes, so it takes no `--app`.

## What drift compares

The AWS side is whatever the resource's provider reads back now. The cdkd side
is the **deploy-time AWS snapshot** in `ResourceState.observedProperties`
(state schema `version: 3`+). A resource written before observed capture
existed, or by a provider with no read-back, has no `observedProperties`; for
those the comparator falls back to `properties`, the user-templated intent.

The difference matters: the observed baseline is what makes a console-side
change to a key you never templated surface as drift, while the fallback only
catches changes to keys you did template. Run
[`cdkd state refresh-observed <stack>`](cli-state.md#cdkd-state-refresh-observed) or redeploy to
populate an observed baseline in place.

The comparator only looks at keys present in cdkd state. AWS-managed fields
cdkd never set — timestamps, generated identifiers, account-wide defaults —
are ignored, so they never surface as false-positive drift.

### Empty undeclared keys are skipped

On the observed-baseline path, a top-level key the template never declared
whose captured value was EMPTY (`[]`, `{}`, `null`) is skipped entirely. Such
keys are typically filled in AFTER the capture by a sibling resource in the
same stack — `AWS::ECS::ClusterCapacityProviderAssociations` populating the
cluster's `CapacityProviders`, a standalone `AWS::AutoScaling::LifecycleHook`
populating the ASG's hook list, standalone security-group ingress and egress
rules — or by AWS itself. Comparing them reported permanent phantom drift on a
freshly deployed stack, and `--revert` then stripped that sibling-managed
configuration out of AWS.

CloudFormation's drift detection likewise compares only template-declared
properties, so this matches its behaviour for that class. An undeclared key
captured with a REAL value — an AWS-side default — is still compared.

### Tags

Tag drift is compared for every SDK provider with a read-back and on the Cloud
Control fallback. cdkd filters `aws:`-prefixed entries (notably `aws:cdk:path`
and `aws:cdk:metadata`) out of the AWS-current snapshot before comparing:
those are injected by CDK as construct metadata rather than as user-managed
`Tags`, so leaving them in would fire drift on every CDK-deployed resource.
The remaining user tags are normalized to CloudFormation's `[{Key, Value}]`
shape and sorted by `Key` for a stable comparison, and the key is omitted
entirely when AWS reports no user tags.

IAM Role, User and Group inline-policy bodies are compared too, via paginated
policy listing plus per-policy reads, reconciled against the order state
records.

## Per-resource outcomes

Every resource ends in exactly one of four states.

| Outcome | Meaning | In the report |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **drifted** | At least one property differs between state and AWS. | `~ <logicalId> (<type>)`, with one `+/-` line per diverging property path. |
| **clean** | Every state-recorded property was compared against AWS and matched. | Counted in the per-stack summary, not listed individually. |
| **not compared** | Nothing differed, but cdkd did not compare every property. | Listed in the partially-compared block, with its own reason. |
| **drift unknown** | Nothing could be read back for the resource. | `? <logicalId> (<type>)`, in a separate block at the bottom of the stack's report. |

A **clean** verdict never means anything except compared-and-matched.

### Why a resource was not compared

`--json` reports the reason per resource as `notCompared[].cause`:

| `cause` | What happened | Clearable? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `refused` | cdkd declined to resolve a dynamic reference the resource's state records, because it could not attribute the reference to a region. Its secret-bearing properties were never looked at. | Yes — spell the reference as a full ARN, which names its region. |
| `unresolvedToken` | State records a `{{resolve:...}}` spelling cdkd resolves for nobody. cdkd resolves all three CloudFormation services (`secretsmanager`, `ssm`, `ssm-secure`), so this is reserved for text that is not a dynamic reference at all, or a service AWS adds later. | No — a re-run cannot clear it, which is why it alone does not affect the exit code. |
| `readFailed` | The read or the comparison threw, so NONE of that resource's properties were compared. Every other resource in the stack is still compared and reported. | Yes — usually a missing permission or a throttle; grant it or re-run. |
| `baselineRefused` | A [`cdkd import`](import.md#the-drift-baseline-an-import-records) run refused to capture that resource's observed baseline, so the only baseline available is the recorded properties that refusal already found untrustworthy. NONE of its properties were compared, and cdkd does not read it back from AWS at all. | Yes — deploy a change to the resource, which rebuilds its record from your template and captures a real baseline. |
| `uncertifiedBaseline` | The recorded baseline holds the redaction mask `***` at a position cdkd could not pair with the secret reference there (see [a position cdkd could not certify](#the-other-cause-of-a-masked-baseline-a-position-cdkd-could-not-certify)), and the mask is the only difference at that position. Every other property was compared. | Yes — deploy a change to the resource, which re-captures the baseline. |
| `unreadableRecord` | The state record holds a row that cannot be read as a resource — it is not an object, or it carries no resource type — or its whole `resources` map is not a JSON object. cdkd drops the row (or reads the map as empty) so the rest of the stack is still compared, and reports it here rather than only warning, so a `--json` gate sees it. An unreadable map is reported as one entry whose `logicalId` is `(resources map)`. | Yes — repair or re-import the record. |

The `baselineRefused` cause is recorded on the state record, which means it only
covers a refusal made by a cdkd that knew how to record one (state schema v10 and
later). A stack imported by an older release carries the same untrustworthy
properties with nothing marking them, and `cdkd drift` still compares it.

cdkd cannot tell those apart from the record, so it **says so** instead: when a
stack's state predates v10 and any of the resources it compared has no drift
baseline, `cdkd drift` names the stack, the region, and those resources. It is a
warning rather than a refusal because the same condition also describes stacks
that were never imported at all.

**The warning going away does not mean the records were fixed.** cdkd stamps the
current schema version on every state write, so *any* write — `--accept` or
`--revert` in the same run, or a deploy that changes nothing about those
resources — silences the warning while leaving the untrustworthy properties in
place. On the deploy path it is worse: the baseline refresh then refills those
resources *from* those same properties. The warning says this itself, and the
reliable remedy is to **re-run `cdkd import`** for the stack — or to deploy a
change that actually touches a listed resource, which rebuilds its record from
your template.

A **drifted** resource can be partially compared too: the changes it reports
are real, but they are not the whole comparison, so it carries
`referencesUnresolved: true` alongside them and is rolled up under
`notCompared` as well.

Everything not fully compared is listed under the human report's
`N resource(s) only PARTIALLY compared` block — headed
`N resource(s) NOT fully compared — K not compared AT ALL (<causes>)` when a
resource none of whose properties were compared is present — `readFailed`,
`baselineRefused` or `unreadableRecord` — with each cause present named in the
parentheses, since calling such a resource "partially compared" understates
it. Each entry names its own
reason, and the per-resource detail also goes to the log, which a caller
piping stdout does not see.

The usual causes are a least-privilege role without
`secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` / `ssm:GetParameter`, a deleted or
rotated-away secret, and a cross-region reference cdkd refuses to resolve in
the consumer's region because that would compare against — and under
`--revert`, write — a different region's same-named secret.

### What "drift unknown" excludes from the count

A resource nothing was read for is **excluded from the summary's "checked"
count** and reported separately as `N unsupported`. A stack whose only
resource is unsupported prints:

```text
⚠ ... no drift detected, but NOTHING was compared — 0 of 1 resource checked (1 unsupported)
```

The glyph follows the question "was everything actually compared", so a stack
in which nothing was compared does not get a reassuring `✓`. The **exit code
is still `0`** — only the claim about coverage changes. The same applies to a
stack whose resources are all Custom Resources, which are reported as
`skipped`.

Both the `N checked` and the `N of M fully checked` spellings count only
resources a comparison was attempted for. In the `N of M` spelling the
unsupported total sits OUTSIDE the parenthetical — `1 of 3 resources fully
checked (2 only partially compared), 1 unsupported` — so the bracketed figure
accounts for exactly the gap between the two numbers rather than reading as a
third share of `M`.

### What the human report does to a malformed value

The report prints values it reads out of the state record, out of the S3 key
the record was listed under and out of the AWS readback: the stack name and
region in every heading (from the key — from the record body only for a legacy
region-less record's region), each row's logical id and resource type and the
state side of each change (from the record, which a hand edit can fill with
anything `JSON.parse` accepts), each changed property's path, and the AWS side
of each change (whatever the service returns). The report treats all of them
as untrusted text, the way the [`cdkd state` human
views](cli-state.md#what-the-human-views-do-to-a-malformed-record) do:

- **A control character is replaced by a space in every one of those fields.**
  That covers a newline, an escape sequence, LINE SEPARATOR and the bidi
  overrides. The output is line-oriented, and this report is exactly the text a
  reader trusts to say whether a stack matches AWS, so a newline in a logical id
  would invent a `✓ ... no drift detected` row and an override could reorder a
  changed-property line. The escape BYTE is replaced and the characters around
  it are kept — with one allowance: a value spelling one of the styling codes
  cdkd's own output uses (`ESC[31m` and its sibling colours, bold, dim and
  reset) keeps it, the same allowance every logger line has. Such a value can
  set a colour or a style — for the rows after it too, if it never resets it —
  but cannot move the cursor, clear the screen or plant a link. A structured
  value (an object or a list) is JSON-encoded first, so a newline or an escape
  byte nested inside it arrives as JSON's own `\n` / `\u001b` escape text and
  stays that way — inert — while LINE SEPARATOR and the bidi overrides, which
  JSON leaves literal, are replaced like anywhere else.
- **An identifier is cut with a `...` mark past 255 characters** (the stack
  name past the longer bound a nested `Parent~Child` name legitimately needs),
  which bounds how much of the screen a planted multi-kilobyte name can take —
  a bound, not a guarantee that the rows after it stay in view, since a name
  can still wrap within it. A property value is never cut, and neither an
  identifier nor a value is trimmed: an ordinary value prints byte-for-byte as
  it always did, and a drift that differs only by surrounding whitespace still
  shows two different sides.

`--json` is untouched — a consumer of that mode wants the stored value.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` (detection) | Nothing drifted, and every resource under `notCompared`, if any, is there for an `unresolvedToken`. |
| `0` (`--accept` / `--revert`) | The remediation run completed. This does NOT assert every comparison completed. |
| `1` | Drift was detected on at least one resource, OR the command failed (no state found, an AWS error, bad arguments). |
| `2` (detection) | Nothing drifted, but at least one comparison did not happen for a reason you can act on. |
| `2` (`--revert`) | The revert finished with one or more resources not reverted. |

The full cross-command table is in the
[CLI Reference](cli-reference.md#exit-codes).

**Drift outranks a partial comparison.** A run that both detects drift and
leaves something uncompared exits `1`, not `2`. Both the drift case and the
crash case go through the same error handler; drift detection emits the full
human report before throwing, so that report is the only output for it.

**Exit `2` on detection is narrower than `notCompared`, deliberately.** Five of
the causes in the [table above](#why-a-resource-was-not-compared) produce it: a
resource cdkd `refused` to compare, one whose read or comparison `readFailed`,
one whose baseline an import refused (`baselineRefused`), one whose baseline
holds a mask cdkd could not certify (`uncertifiedBaseline`), and a state row that
is not readable as a resource (`unreadableRecord`). The sixth does not: a
resource whose only uncompared properties hold an
`unresolvedToken` is listed under `notCompared` and in the report's
not-fully-compared block, but does not produce this exit code — cdkd resolves
that spelling for nobody, the condition is permanent, and exiting non-zero for
it would fail such a stack's CI forever over something unrelated. A type
Cloud Control has no READ handler for is excluded on the same grounds and
reports `drift unknown` instead, whether the fallback signals that by
returning nothing or by throwing `UnsupportedActionException`.

**A remediation run keeps exit `0` even when the comparison was incomplete.**
`--accept` and `--revert` keep their own exit codes, so a run whose reads were
refused or failed still exits `0`. It says so in words instead: such a run
prints `Comparison INCOMPLETE — nothing to accept/revert, and that is NOT a
clean bill of health`, names how many of the stack's resources were not
compared and why, splits them into the ones cdkd is genuinely uncertain about
(a failed read, a refused or unresolvable dynamic reference) and the ones it
never drift-checks by design (`Custom::*`, and types no provider reads back
yet, reported without any uncertainty claim), and points at the detection-only
run, which DOES report exit `2`. Nothing is written on the strength of a
comparison that did not happen: `--accept` and `--revert` act on drifted
resources only. `--accept` likewise exits `0` when it deliberately refused a
secret-bearing property whose AWS-current value it could not identify — the
refusal is warned about by name, and the drift is still reported next run.

**To gate CI on "everything was actually compared"**, run `cdkd drift`
WITHOUT `--accept` / `--revert` and read its exit code, or read `--json`'s
`notCompared[].cause`.

**Exit `2` on `--revert`** (`PartialFailureError`) covers three shapes: a
`provider.update` call that failed, one that threw
`ResourceUpdateNotSupportedError`, and — counted and reported separately,
since it never reached `provider.update` at all — a resource whose recorded
dynamic reference(s) cdkd could not re-resolve. Grant the caller
`secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` / `ssm:GetParameter`, or fix the reference.
That last counter also covers a resource `--revert` refused because its
recorded baseline holds only the redaction mask and AWS reports nothing to
preserve there, and one refused because its baseline holds a raw
CloudFormation intrinsic **object** (`Fn::Join` / `Ref`) cdkd cannot resolve
outside a deploy — for both, no AWS call is made and the message names the
remedy.

A resource whose baseline a
[`cdkd import`](import.md#the-drift-baseline-an-import-records) run refused is
**not** in that tally: detection declines to compare it at all, so it never
becomes drifted and `--revert` never considers it. It is reported under
`notCompared` with the cause `baselineRefused`, which a detection-only run
exits `2` for.

**The import refusal is the one that also stops `--accept`**, and it is
per-resource rather than per-property. Such a resource has no baseline, so
`--accept` would write the AWS readback into its recorded *properties*,
positioned against properties the import already found untrustworthy — which
can persist a resolved secret in plaintext. `--revert` has the mirror problem:
it would push those properties to AWS, overwriting whatever the resource really
holds. Both decline, name the resource, and point at the same remedy: **deploy
a change to it**, which rebuilds its record from your template and captures a
real baseline. Such a resource is **not reported as drifted either**: detection declines to
compare it at all and reports it under `notCompared` with the cause
`baselineRefused`. Comparing it would have meant rendering the live AWS value —
including a decrypted secret — as one side of a drift row that nothing could
mask, because a refused record spells no `{{resolve:...}}` for the redaction to
key on. Successful resources are in sync; re-run `cdkd drift '<stacks...>'`
to see what is left, then either `cdkd drift '<stacks...>' --revert` for the
recoverable failures or `cdkd deploy <stack> --replace` for the
update-not-supported ones. (That is the partial-failure message's own spelling:
a QUOTED placeholder, because the `[stacks...]` that `cdkd drift --help` prints
is a bracket expression when pasted — it matches one character from
`s t a c k .`, so in a directory holding a file named `s` the line expands and
retargets, which on the `--revert` half writes to AWS. The arity is the same
optional variadic either way.)

## Secret and redacted values

**Secret dynamic references** — `{{resolve:secretsmanager:...}}`,
`{{resolve:ssm-secure:...}}`, and `{{resolve:ssm:...}}` naming a
`SecureString` parameter — are compared like-for-like. cdkd state is written to
hold the unresolved expression rather than the plaintext, so `cdkd drift`
re-resolves the baseline in memory before comparing it against the AWS-current
snapshot. In its DETECTION modes the resolved value stays in memory for the
comparison and nothing is written back. `--accept` is the exception: it writes
the AWS-current values into state, and what it writes goes through the same
redaction — which substitutes only where it can certify the position. What
happens at a position it cannot certify depends on where the write lands: into
`observedProperties` (a record that has one) the position is written as `***`,
the same fail-closed rule the baseline refreshes below apply; into
`properties` (a record with no observed baseline) the value is persisted as it
came back from AWS, because a mask there would block `cdkd export` and the
rollback replay over a template value that was never unknown.

The stored side is a redaction pass rather than a guarantee — it substitutes
only where it can match the value against the template position it came from,
and a stored record can still hold a plaintext a deploy could not certify. If
you need to know whether a given stack's state holds one, `cdkd scrub --dry-run
--fail` is the check; `cdkd drift` does not answer that question.

This means `cdkd drift` needs **read access to the referenced secrets**:
`secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` for a `secretsmanager` reference, and
`ssm:GetParameter` (with `kms:Decrypt` on the parameter's key) for an `ssm`
one. If the caller lacks the permission, or the secret has been deleted, cdkd
**warns and continues** — that one resource's secret-bearing properties are
reported as neither clean nor drifted, and every other resource and stack in
the run is unaffected.

What the report may show at a secret-bearing property is deliberately narrow:

- When AWS holds the value the reference resolves to, both sides render as the
  `{{resolve:...}}` expression, so the property is clean and nothing is
  printed.
- When AWS holds anything else, the property is reported as drifted with the
  AWS side shown as `***`. The commonest cause is a **Secrets Manager
  rotation**, where the deployed resource still carries the previous version,
  but an out-of-band console edit looks identical from here — cdkd cannot tell
  a stale secret from a non-secret edit, so it prints neither.
- When AWS returns **nothing** for that exact property, it is reported as
  neither clean nor drifted. A write-only credential (`MasterUserPassword` and
  friends) is not returned by any read-back, so an absence there means "cannot
  be checked", not "was removed"; reporting it would make `cdkd drift` exit `1`
  forever on every stack with a templated credential. This applies to the
  property itself only. A whole block disappearing — the console's "remove all
  environment variables" — IS reported, and `--accept` refuses it, because
  accepting an absence deletes the key and would take the `{{resolve:...}}`
  reference with it. Use `--revert` for that shape.
- `--accept` **refuses** such a property and says so: it will not write `***`
  into state, and it will not write a value it could not identify. The drift
  keeps being reported. Properties that are not secret-bearing are accepted
  normally in the same run, and `--accept --dry-run` prints the same refusal
  the real run will make.
- `--revert` re-resolves before calling the provider, so the live resource
  receives the concrete secret rather than the literal `{{resolve:...}}` token.

### Redacted (`NoEcho`) baselines

Where a `NoEcho` custom-resource `Data` value was resolved into a property,
cdkd state holds the literal mask `***` rather than an expression — the value
was generated by the handler, so there is nothing to re-resolve. The three
arms above therefore answer differently, and none of them needs a
`{{resolve:...}}` reference to fire:

- the report shows the position but MASKS the AWS-current side, so the live
  value is not printed;
- `--accept` refuses the property, because accepting would write the live
  plaintext over a deliberate redaction;
- `--revert` leaves that position exactly as AWS has it rather than pushing
  the mask — *when it can tell which live value belongs there.* It refuses the
  whole resource (counted with the other unresolvable ones, exit `2`) whenever
  it cannot, because sending `***` would corrupt the live value and dropping
  the key would delete a property the resource may require. Three cases
  refuse: AWS reports nothing at that position; AWS reports a LIST whose
  elements cannot be matched to the recorded ones; and — a defensive arm no
  known readback shape reaches today — the mask sits inside a container cdkd
  will not rebuild (a non-plain object such as a `Date` or binary value). A list is matched by an identity
  field (`Name` or `Key`) when both sides carry one, and otherwise by the
  array's own surviving literal values; a list AWS returns in another order
  with no identity field, or one carrying two masked entries, cannot be
  matched, and guessing would write one entry's secret onto another. Values
  the revert itself substituted — a preserved `{{resolve:...}}` token cdkd
  resolves for nobody — vouch for nothing, so a list whose only other values
  are such tokens refuses too.

**Such a position drifts on every run, and that is expected.** cdkd's side is
the mask and AWS's side is the real value, so the two never converge: the
resource is reported as drifted, the report renders `***` on both sides, and
detection-only mode exits `1` indefinitely. cdkd does NOT drop the comparison
the way it drops an absent write-only credential — there the read is
impossible and the comparison meaningless, whereas here the live value is
genuinely readable and cdkd simply cannot say what belongs there. Silently
hiding it would claim a clean bill of health it has no basis for.

To clear it, force the custom resource to update — change one of its
properties, a nonce being the usual way — and re-deploy, so its handler runs
again and supplies the value. An ordinary re-deploy leaves the resource
unchanged, so the handler does not run and the mask stays. If a stack in this
state must gate CI on drift, either stop marking that response `NoEcho`, so
the value round-trips normally, or gate on `--json` and filter the known
position out.

A property whose real value happens to BE the string `***` is treated the same
way, since nothing in state distinguishes the two — see
[State Management](state-management.md#noecho-custom-resource-responses).

#### The other cause of a masked baseline: a position cdkd could not certify

A `NoEcho` response is not the only way the mask reaches a baseline. When cdkd
refreshes `observedProperties` — during a deploy, from
[`cdkd state refresh-observed`](cli-state.md#cdkd-state-refresh-observed),
from the baseline [`cdkd import`](import.md) captures for each resource it
adopts, from `cdkd drift --accept` on a record that has one, or from the
narrowing `--revert` records when a provider reports it delivered something
other than what it was sent — it rewrites the decrypted value AWS returns back
onto the `{{resolve:...}}` reference the record holds, **by position**. Where
the readback and the record cannot be lined up at a reference-bearing position,
cdkd has no way to tell a resolved secret from an ordinary literal, so it
writes `***` there instead of the value AWS reported. Shapes that reach it:

- AWS restructured the property (an object returned as a list, an extra nesting
  level, a scalar returned as a container);
- AWS normalised an identity field, so a list element lost its counterpart —
  `Name: 'db'` echoed back as `'DB'`, or a name expanded to an ARN;
- a list with no identity field that AWS reordered, or in which it normalised
  one of the neighbouring literal values;
- the record's properties hold a raw `Fn::Join` / `Fn::Sub` **object** where the
  readback holds a string, which is what `cdkd import` writes when a reference
  names a resource outside the imported set (it warns when it does).

Everything the record itself spells at that position — the surrounding literal
values, an already-stored `{{resolve:...}}` reference, numbers and booleans —
is kept, so an ordinary baseline is unaffected. A neighbouring value AWS
normalised is masked along with the secret; that is deliberate over-masking, and
the reason is that the alternative is writing a decrypted secret into
`state.json`.

The effect on drift differs from a `NoEcho` mask. cdkd cannot say what belongs
at such a position, so it does not call the position drifted:

- when the mask is the **only** difference there — every other value at that
  position, list lengths and order included, matches AWS — the position is
  reported as not compared, with the cause `uncertifiedBaseline`, and a
  detection-only run exits `2` rather than `1`;
- anything else AWS reports there — an edited neighbouring value, a list that
  grew, shrank or came back in another order — is still reported as drift, with
  the AWS side masked, and `--accept` refuses it;
- the rest of the resource is compared as usual, so a real change elsewhere
  still reports the resource drifted (exit `1`), with the cause alongside.

A secret changed *at* a masked position cannot be seen; that is inherent to a
position cdkd cannot name. Two shapes keep reporting as drift: a masked element
of a list declared unordered, which is sorted apart from its live counterpart,
and a masked binary value, which only a string can match.

A position reported as not compared is left alone by both remediation modes:
`--accept` writes nothing over it, and `--revert` sends AWS's own value there
back unchanged, even when a real change elsewhere in the same property is
being reverted. Where it is still reported as drift, `--revert` is where the two mask
populations differ — a mask written for the reasons listed above exists
*because* the record and the readback could not be matched at that position,
which is exactly when `--revert` has no live value it may safely copy. So expect
it to refuse the whole resource here more often than for a `NoEcho` value.

The fix is a deploy that actually creates or updates that resource, after which
the baseline is captured from a template cdkd can position against. A plain
`cdkd deploy` that finds nothing to change does **not** clear it: the
**automatic refresh** cdkd runs at the start of a deploy only fills in a
*missing* baseline, and a mask is not missing. A create or update rewrites the
baseline unconditionally, which is why it is the remedy.

The last shape in the list — a record whose properties hold a raw `Fn::Join` /
`Fn::Sub` **object** — has a second consequence of its own: when such a record
also has no `observedProperties` (the same import produced neither), the raw
object becomes the revert baseline itself. `--revert` **refuses the resource**
rather than write it (counted with the unresolvable ones, exit `2`): cdkd
cannot resolve an intrinsic outside a deploy, and no provider route rejects
the raw object on cdkd's side — an SDK provider puts it straight into the wire
call, and Cloud Control serializes it into the patch, where a JSON-string
property would even make it a schema-valid string AWS accepts silently. The
remedy is the same `cdkd deploy`, which resolves the template and records a
resolvable baseline.

`cdkd drift --accept` does not write this mask itself — it records what AWS
reported. For a resource that has no baseline yet, that write lands in
`properties` — the fallback described under `--accept` below — where a mask
would block [`cdkd export`](cli-export.md) and the rollback replay rather than
protect anything. For a resource that already has a baseline, `--accept` writes
the baseline.

`cdkd import`'s own baseline capture **does** write it, for the same reason a
deploy's does: its one destination is `observedProperties`. So a stack freshly
adopted with `cdkd import` can report a masked position on its very first
`cdkd drift` run, before any deploy has run at all.

### Tokens that are not references

Every CloudFormation spelling — `secretsmanager`, `ssm` and `ssm-secure` — is
resolved and therefore maskable, so a `{{resolve:...}}` token that survives
the pass is text that merely looks like a reference, or a service AWS adds
later. The value AWS holds at such a position is reported as ordinary data:
masking it would leave a path refused by `--accept` and pinned by `--revert`
with no remedy you could apply.

A reference cdkd does not resolve at all is **not** an error and is **not**
compared. The property is reported as neither clean nor drifted, and a warning
names the token once per resource.

What a `--revert` triggered by another drifted property on the same resource
does to those positions depends on where the token sits:

- If the property's **whole value** is the token and cdkd can **match the
  position** against what AWS reports, the live value is left **unchanged** —
  cdkd cannot tell what the token should resolve to, so it keeps what AWS has.
  A token at the top level always matches; a token inside a **list** matches
  through its element — by an identity field (`Name` or `Key`) when both sides
  carry one, and otherwise only when the list's other literal values
  corroborate the order (the same pairing rule the masked-baseline revert
  uses, because a list AWS reordered would otherwise donate **another
  element's** live value to the token's position).
- If the position cannot be matched — AWS reports nothing there, the list was
  reordered or resized past what its own values can vouch for, two elements
  carry tokens, or the list holds nothing BUT tokens — or the value AWS holds
  there is **not a string** (a list or an object at a position the token types
  as a string), the token is written **literally**, exactly as `cdkd deploy`
  sends it. For a stack cdkd deployed
  that is a no-op (AWS already holds the literal); for a record adopted from
  elsewhere it preserves whatever breakage already existed rather than
  guessing. A **one-element list against a one-element readback always
  matches**: there is no other element to mis-pair with, so the live value is
  preserved there even when nothing else in the element corroborates.
- If the token is **embedded in a longer string**, that string is written
  **with the token literal**, exactly as `cdkd deploy` does, so a value AWS
  holds there **is overwritten**.

Both the drift warning and the revert warning state which of the two applies,
and the drift one is printed before the confirmation prompt.

A stack whose AWS side and state side BOTH hold a literal
`{{resolve:ssm-secure:...}}` token — written by a cdkd release that predates
`ssm-secure` resolution — reads as `NO_CHANGE` on the deploy diff, so
upgrading does not repair the live value on its own. For a property the
provider reads back, `cdkd drift` reports it (the resolved value no longer
matches the literal) and `--revert` writes the resolved value. A write-only
destination (`MasterUserPassword`, `LoginProfile.Password`) needs that
property to be updated once.

## Resource type coverage

Drift detection works for every resource type routed through the Cloud Control
API, which is the majority of cdkd's surface. SDK providers add their own
first-class read-back per type, which avoids the Cloud Control round-trip and
lets the provider map AWS's response shape back to the CloudFormation shape
cdkd state stores.

These SDK-provider types ship with a first-class read-back:

| Service | Types |
| --- | --- |
| `AWS::ApiGateway` | `Account`, `Authorizer`, `Deployment`, `Method`, `Resource`, `Stage` |
| `AWS::ApiGatewayV2` | `Api`, `Authorizer`, `Integration`, `Route`, `Stage` |
| `AWS::AppSync` | `ApiKey`, `DataSource`, `GraphQLApi`, `GraphQLSchema`, `Resolver` |
| `AWS::AutoScaling` | `AutoScalingGroup` |
| `AWS::BedrockAgentCore` | `Browser`, `CodeInterpreter`, `Evaluator`, `Runtime` |
| `AWS::CertificateManager` | `Certificate` |

| `AWS::DynamoDB` | `GlobalTable`, `Table` |
| `AWS::EC2` | `EIP`, `Instance`, `InternetGateway`, `NatGateway`, `NetworkAcl`, `NetworkAclEntry`, `Route`, `RouteTable`, `SecurityGroup`, `SecurityGroupIngress`, `Subnet`, `SubnetNetworkAclAssociation`, `SubnetRouteTableAssociation`, `VPC`, `VPCGatewayAttachment` |
| `AWS::ECR` | `Repository` |

| `AWS::RDS` | `DBCluster`, `DBInstance`, `DBProxy`, `DBProxyEndpoint`, `DBProxyTargetGroup`, `DBSubnetGroup` |
| `AWS::Route53` | `HostedZone`, `RecordSet` |
| `AWS::S3` | `Bucket`, `BucketPolicy` |
| `AWS::S3Express` | `DirectoryBucket` |
| `AWS::S3Tables` | `Namespace`, `Table`, `TableBucket` |

| `AWS::Scheduler` | `Schedule` |
| `AWS::SecretsManager` | `Secret` |
| `AWS::ServiceDiscovery` | `HttpNamespace`, `PrivateDnsNamespace`, `PublicDnsNamespace`, `Service` |
| `AWS::SNS` | `Subscription`, `Topic`, `TopicPolicy` |
| `AWS::SQS` | `Queue`, `QueuePolicy` |
| `AWS::SSM` | `Parameter` |
| `AWS::StepFunctions` | `StateMachine` |
| `AWS::WAFv2` | `WebACL` |

Five SDK-provider types have no first-class read-back yet and take the Cloud
Control fallback described below, exactly as a type with no SDK provider does:
`AWS::Budgets::Budget`, `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack`,
`AWS::CloudWatch::AnomalyDetector`, `AWS::EMR::InstanceFleetConfig` and
`AWS::EMR::InstanceGroupConfig`. `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack` is deny-listed
on that fallback, so it reports `drift unknown`.

> [!NOTE]
> **physicalId formats.** Several types above
> (`AWS::ApiGateway::Method`, `AWS::Route53::RecordSet`,
> `AWS::AppSync::DataSource` / `Resolver` / `ApiKey`, `AWS::Glue::Table`,
> `AWS::S3Tables::Namespace` / `Table`, and the EC2 sub-resources) are
> identified by a **composite, `|`-delimited physical id** rather than a
> single scalar. That composite is what `cdkd state show` /
> `cdkd state resources` print and what
> `cdkd import --resource <logicalId>=<physicalId>` expects — quote it on a
> shell command line. The per-type format table is in
> [State Management](state-management.md#composite-pipe-delimited-physicalids).

### False-drift prevention on the Cloud Control fallback

When an SDK provider has no read-back of its own, drift falls back to Cloud
Control's generic `GetResource`. cdkd state's `properties` field is in
CloudFormation-template shape — what the provider's create call was passed —
and Cloud Control's response is usually the same shape, but for some resource
types it diverges enough to fire false drift on every run. Two guards protect
the fallback:

1. **Deny-list.** Types with verified structural divergence short-circuit to
   `drift unknown` before the Cloud Control call fires. Current entries are
   `AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi` (its `Body` / `BodyS3Location` are write-only
   inputs the response omits, while cdkd state preserves them),
   `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack` (the response is runtime stack state — outputs
   and status — not the template parameters cdkd stores), and
   `AWS::EC2::LaunchTemplate` (the response carries version-bumped
   `LaunchTemplateData` plus a synthetic `LatestVersionNumber`).
2. **Strip pass.** Known AWS-managed timestamp, owner and generated-id fields
   (`CreationDate`, `LastModifiedTime`, `OwnerId`, `RevisionId`, and
   similar) are removed from Cloud Control responses before the comparator
   sees them. The list is conservative: name-collision-prone fields that some
   CloudFormation types use as legitimate inputs (`Status`, `State`,
   `VersionId`, `Arn`) are NOT stripped, so a real `Status` change on
   `AWS::ECS::CapacityProvider.ManagedScaling` still surfaces as drift.

A deny-listed type is fixed by giving it a first-class SDK read-back, which
makes the deny-list entry unreachable.

## Resolving drift: `--accept` and `--revert`

Once `cdkd drift` has detected drift, the same command can resolve it. The two
flags are mutually exclusive — pick the direction that matches the intent.

Both acquire the per-stack lock (the same one `cdkd deploy` uses) before
mutating anything, and both prompt for confirmation unless `-y` / `--yes` is
set. `--dry-run` prints the planned mutations and exits `0` without acquiring
a lock or touching AWS / S3.

Both are no-ops on a clean stack. Resources reported as `drift unknown` are
skipped by both, because the comparator never produced a property difference
for them.

**A dropped row is REPORTED, and the run does not exit `0`.** An entry the
detection run could not read is reported as `not compared` — it appears in the
`--json` payload with the cause `unreadableRecord`, in the `NOT fully compared`
block, and in the exit code, which becomes `2` — or `1` when something else
drifted, since drift outranks a partial comparison. That matters because the
warning goes to stderr, which `cdkd drift --json > report.json` discards: a
record with one unreadable row would otherwise produce a clean report about a
stack cdkd could not fully read. The healthy rows beside it are still compared.

**Both write modes refuse a malformed record, where plain `cdkd drift` reports on one.**
The direction depends on whether the run can write. A detection run cannot, so
a `resources` bag that is not a JSON object is treated as empty and a
`resources` entry that is not an object, or carries no resource type, is left
out of the report — each with a
warning naming the stack, the region and, for entries, the logical ids. Each is
also reported as not compared with the cause `unreadableRecord` — one entry per
dropped row, and one named `(resources map)` for an unreadable map — so the run
exits `2` rather than reading as a clean stack (or `1` when something drifted,
since drift outranks a partial comparison). `--accept` and `--revert` write
the record back, and both rebuild it by spreading the stored bag: spreading a
list produces a well-formed-looking map keyed `0`, `1`, … rather than failing,
which would persist rows for resources that do not exist and erase the only
evidence the record was broken. So both refuse instead, naming the stack, the
region and the offending logical ids, before the lock is acquired and before
anything is written. Inspect the record with `cdkd state show <stack> --json`.

### `--accept` (state ← AWS)

Writes the AWS-current values into cdkd's S3 state file. Use it when the
AWS-side change is the intentional source of truth — typically a manual
console edit you want cdkd to catch up to without redeploying. **AWS resources
are not modified.**

By default the write lands in `observedProperties`, the deploy-time snapshot
used as the drift baseline, so the next drift run reports clean while
`properties` — the last-deployed template intent — is left untouched. For a
resource with no `observedProperties`, the write falls back to `properties`.

The state ETag captured during the read is forwarded as an `IfMatch`
precondition on the save, so a concurrent `cdkd deploy` cannot race the write.

### `--revert` (AWS ← state)

Calls each drifted resource's `provider.update` to push state values back into
AWS. The desired properties are built as the AWS-current snapshot — captured
during the drift read, with no second AWS call — with the **drifted top-level
subtrees overlaid from `observedProperties ?? properties`**, the same
precedence the comparator uses. `previousProperties` is the AWS-current
snapshot itself.

Net effect: every drifted property is pushed back to its state-recorded value,
while non-drifted properties carry their AWS-current values on both sides, so
a diff-based `update()` (SNS, IAM Role) sees `newVal === oldVal` for them and
does not touch AWS for those keys. `--revert` undoes exactly the delta
`cdkd drift` reported and leaves non-drifted attributes alone.

Per-resource failures are collected and surface as `PartialFailureError` at
the end of the run; one resource's failure does not abort the rest. cdkd state
is normally NOT modified — once `provider.update` succeeds, AWS matches state
by definition, so a subsequent `cdkd drift` reports clean. The one exception
is a provider-reported narrowing, below.

#### Tags a revert preserves

A drifted **top-level tag list** keeps any AWS-SERVICE-authored entry instead
of stripping it. Every ordinary tag still reverts exactly as before: one the
baseline lost is re-added, a changed value is reset, and a user- or
console-added tag AWS alone carries is still REMOVED. But a service-managed
key — `AmazonECSManaged`, or any `aws:`-reserved prefix — survives. ECS
attaches `AmazonECSManaged` to an ASG when a capacity provider binds it, and
managed scaling breaks without it, so a strip-everything revert would break
the live resource.

The `--revert` plan names each preserved key before the confirmation prompt.

The carve-out applies to a top-level property NAMED `Tags`, or one whose name
ends in `Tags` — the `[{Key, Value}]` shape alone is not tag-exclusive, as
`LoadBalancerAttributes` shows — and it applies even when the recorded
baseline list is EMPTY, since a declared-but-empty `Tags` still has an AWS
side worth diffing. A tag list NESTED inside another property, such as an EC2
launch template's `TagSpecifications`, still reverts wholesale.

#### AWS-authored values a revert leaves alone

A revert overwrites each drifted top-level subtree from
`observedProperties ?? properties`. When a resource has NO `observedProperties`
— older state, or a deploy-time capture that failed — the desired side is the
raw template, and anything AWS wrote into that subtree that the template never
declared is indistinguishable from an out-of-band change.

cdkd preserves those paths and lists them before the confirmation prompt, in
two forms:

- nested object keys report dotted: `Parameters.table_type`;
- a KEYED `[{Key, Value}]` list reports its missing entries in bracket form:
  `LoadBalancerAttributes[deletion_protection.enabled]`. The bracket
  distinguishes a list entry from a nested path, since attribute keys contain
  dots of their own.

A service-authored tag is not listed — the tag carve-out above preserves it
either way. A POSITIONAL array is compared wholesale, because its elements
have positions rather than identities, so it is neither reported nor narrowed.

#### Resources with no observed-capture baseline

On that same baseline the revert **leaves every untemplated value alone**:
cdkd merges those paths into the bag it actually SENDS, instead of overlaying
the drifted subtree wholesale. Merging on the desired side — rather than
trimming `previousProperties` — is what makes this hold for both provider
shapes: one that key-diffs a collection would otherwise put those paths on its
removal path, and one that replaces a bag wholesale (`PutBucketTagging` is
documented full-replace) never consults the previous side at all.

The plan prints, per affected resource, a
`! this resource has no observed-capture baseline ... LEAVES N AWS-authored
values untouched` line naming each path, before the confirmation prompt and
under `--dry-run`. A Glue Iceberg table's `table_type` / `metadata_location`,
and the roughly eighteen untemplated attributes an ELBv2 load balancer
reports, survive the revert instead of being reset.

Run **`cdkd state refresh-observed <stack>`**, or redeploy, if you want them
reverted too. Either populates `observedProperties`, after which the baseline
IS a deploy-time AWS snapshot, an out-of-band addition is genuinely
identifiable and IS stripped, and the notice stops firing.

Only DRIFTED top-level keys are ever narrowed; non-drifted keys keep their
AWS-current values on both sides.

#### Narrowed values written back to state

Some providers answer `update()` with the bag they ACTUALLY sent, because AWS
only accepts a narrower form than the template declares — `AWS::EC2::Route`'s
single destination, an `AWS::EC2::SecurityGroupIngress` `IpProtocol` coerced
to a string. `--revert` records that narrowing, writing ONLY the keys the
provider changed into the same field the comparator uses as its baseline
(`observedProperties` when the resource has one, else `properties`). Without
it the next `cdkd drift` would report the identical difference and `--revert`
would re-issue the identical call, forever.

Only the provider-changed keys move. The AWS-current values that rode along in
the bag sent to `provider.update` are NOT imported into state, so `--revert`
never behaves like `--accept`. Two further limits keep that guarantee airtight:

- only a key the baseline ALREADY declares can move, so a provider echoing
  back an out-of-band, AWS-only key cannot insert it;
- on a resource with no `observedProperties`, only a key REMOVAL is recorded,
  never a value. That baseline is the raw template, the values sent to the
  provider deliberately carry the untemplated AWS paths described above, and
  writing one into `properties` would make the template intent describe
  AWS-side data.

The write is BEST-EFFORT: AWS has already been reverted by the time it runs,
so a failed state write warns and the command carries on — under `--all`,
aborting would skip every later stack's revert. The only cost of the warn path
is that the narrowing re-surfaces on the next `cdkd drift`.

#### Update-not-supported resources

Some resource types are immutable in AWS (`AWS::Lambda::LayerVersion`,
sub-resource attachments such as `AWS::Lambda::Permission` and
`AWS::ApiGateway::Deployment`) or do not yet have an in-place `update()` in
cdkd (`AWS::AppSync::*`, `AWS::EFS::*`,
`AWS::KinesisFirehose::DeliveryStream`, `AWS::ApiGatewayV2::*`,
`AWS::ApiGateway::Authorizer` / `Deployment` / `Method`,
`AWS::Glue::Database`, `AWS::ServiceDiscovery::*`,
`AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::LoadBalancer`).

For those, `--revert` surfaces a distinct
`⊘ <stack>/<id> (<type>): could not revert — ...` line carrying a
`ResourceUpdateNotSupportedError` and an explicit suggestion. The summary then
names them separately (`N reverted, M update-not-supported`) and the run exits
`2`. The fix is to redeploy the stack with `cdkd deploy --replace`, or destroy
and redeploy — the same recovery path you would use for a CloudFormation
immutable-property error.

AWS update failures — a `provider.update()` call that returns a runtime error
— are reported separately with a `✗` glyph and counted as `failed`. The fix
there is to inspect the AWS error and retry once the underlying cause is
resolved.

## JSON output

`--json` emits an array of per-stack reports:

```json
[
  {
    "stack": "MyStack",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "drifted": [
      {
        "logicalId": "Bucket1",
        "type": "AWS::S3::Bucket",
        "changes": [
          {
            "path": "VersioningConfiguration.Status",
            "stateValue": "Enabled",
            "awsValue": "Suspended"
          }
        ],
        "referencesUnresolved": false
      }
    ],
    "clean": [
      { "logicalId": "Queue1", "type": "AWS::SQS::Queue", "referencesUnresolved": false }
    ],
    "notSupported": [
      { "logicalId": "Function1", "type": "AWS::Lambda::Function" }
    ],
    "notCompared": []
  }
]
```

A report may also carry a `warnings` array of stack-level advisory strings. It
is **omitted when there is nothing to say**, so an ordinary payload is unchanged.
It exists because cdkd's warnings go to stderr while this payload goes to
stdout — a pipeline that captures only stdout would otherwise miss them:

```json
[
  {
    "stack": "LegacyStack",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "warnings": [
      "LegacyStack (us-east-1): this stack's state predates cdkd's refused-baseline marker ..."
    ],
    "drifted": []
  }
]
```

The strings are for a human reading a log, not fields to branch on — they carry
stack names, regions, logical ids and counts, never a property value.

A populated `notCompared`, showing the two per-entry keys:

```json
"notCompared": [
  {
    "logicalId": "Function1",
    "type": "AWS::Lambda::Function",
    "referencesUnresolved": true,
    "cause": "refused"
  },
  {
    "logicalId": "Detector1",
    "type": "AWS::CloudWatch::AnomalyDetector",
    "referencesUnresolved": false,
    "cause": "readFailed"
  }
]
```

The `notCompared` roll-up answers one question `clean` alone cannot: **was the
comparison complete?** When cdkd cannot resolve — or deliberately refuses to
resolve — a dynamic reference a resource's state records, that resource's
secret-bearing properties are not compared at all. The comparator skips those
leaves, so nothing is reported as drifted, which on its own is
indistinguishable from compared-and-matched. The array also carries any
resource whose read or comparison threw, for which nothing at all was
compared.

Such a resource appears under `notCompared` and **not** under `clean`, so
every `clean` entry always carries `referencesUnresolved: false`. A `drifted`
entry can carry `referencesUnresolved: true` and is rolled up under
`notCompared` as well.

Each `notCompared` entry carries two keys of its own:

- **`cause`** — one of the values in the
  [table above](#why-a-resource-was-not-compared). This is the key
  to gate on when you need to tell a clearable cause from a permanent one; the
  exit code says the run had at least one clearable cause but cannot say which
  resource.
- **`referencesUnresolved`** — `true` for the three reference-related causes
  (`refused`, `unresolvedToken`, `uncertifiedBaseline`) and `false` for every
  other one, where nothing
  was compared at all and references are beside the point. A consumer written
  as `notCompared.filter(n => n.referencesUnresolved)` therefore drops those
  entries. Gate on `notCompared.length` — the documented predicate — or on
  `cause`.

So a CI job that gates on drift should read `notCompared`, not just `drifted`:

```bash
# "everything was actually checked, and nothing drifted"
cdkd drift --all --json | jq -e 'all(.[]; .drifted == [] and .notCompared == [])'
```

### Streams under `--json`

With `--json`, **stdout carries the payload and nothing else**, so
`cdkd drift ... --json | jq ...` is safe in every mode, `--accept` and
`--revert` included. Every human-facing line the command would otherwise print
on stdout goes to **stderr** instead: the `--accept` / `--revert` plan, the
confirmation prompt, the `--dry-run` notice,
`No drift detected — nothing to accept.`, the `Comparison INCOMPLETE` block,
the `✓ State updated` and `Revert summary` lines, and `--verbose` debug
output. Warnings and errors were already on stderr and are unaffected.

The lines are **moved, not suppressed**: run the command in a terminal, or
with `2>&1` into a pager, and you see exactly what you would see without
`--json`. Redirect the two streams separately to keep both:

```bash
cdkd drift MyStack --json --accept --yes > report.json 2> progress.log
```

Without `--json`, nothing moves on `cdkd drift` — its human modes print to
stdout as before.

The same contract holds for **every `--json` surface**: `cdkd events --json`
(and its `--format json` alias) and `cdkd state {resources,show,info} --json`
route their `--verbose` debug output and the `Assumed role ...` notice from
`--role-arn` / `CDKD_ROLE_ARN` runs to stderr while `--json` is in effect.
`cdkd diff --json` instead demotes the logger to `warn`, which suppresses
rather than moves its info-level lines.

Neither `cdkd list` nor [`cdkd state list`](cli-state.md#cdkd-state-list) is in
that set, because their reservation is not conditional: they reserve stdout in
EVERY mode, `--json` or not, along with `cdkd synth`,
`cdkd local invoke` and `cdkd local invoke-agentcore` — see
[Output streams: when stdout is a payload](cli-reference.md#output-streams-when-stdout-is-a-payload).
